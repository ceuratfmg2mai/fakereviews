positive"},{"sentence":"The subplots about the homeless characters Block encountered ended up overwhelming the main storyline.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also found Block's

deadline to get this year's Grisham book came a bit quick for John, either that, or he was specifically looking for a movie contract for this story, either way, it was not his best work--but it still held my attention through the whole book","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ah, if only good writers could stay at the top of their game forever...unfortunately, this isn't the case and it's always sad to see one of your favorite authors turn out a lackluster book that seemed to be written with a lack of regard for his readers' intelligence as well as hastily written and poorly edited.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is the case with James Patterson's latest Alex Cross thriller, Violets Are Blue.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The

couldn't help it with this book--I ripped it apart.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I actually kept a piece of paper with me as I read because I found so many flaws, each one nettling me so much that I had to write it down so as not to forget it in my review.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This book is not well-written.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Although Patterson got away with his completely plot-driven books before because the plot was so good, this plot stumbles along and leaves you looking at the writing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In chapters that are written from Cross's point of view, he uses stupid little lines ( that Cross is saying to himself ) like\" Oh, no Kyle!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"God no!\" and\"Kyle, Kyle have mercy on us\".","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"His descriptions of people are borderline ridiculous.","target":"Genuine

negative"},{"sentence":"Another is described as,\" The most sinister looking man I had ever seen.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And he has an unnerving habit of hammering into our skulls that pretty women are pretty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Every time one woman comes into the storyline, he has to mention something about her looks, even though he's already described her as beautiful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It would be okay if it was well-done, but it's not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The lines, like\" She looked at me and she had such beautiful eyes\" made me cringe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is the writing of a complete amateur, not someone who is at the top of his game, as Patterson should be by now.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"2. The book is full of inconsistencies or muddy areas.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, a character is identified as Arthur, and is then called Brody a few pages later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is similar to something I found upsetting in Roses Are Red: there are at least four characters named Betsey, including a major character.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I first started reading it, I thought that it was a pattern and would be explained.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nope.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Apparently he just liked the name Betsey or kept forgetting he'd already used it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a product of bad editing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Come on, James, you're rollin' in the dough!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hire a professional editor!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'd be available for next to nothing!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"3.

The things Cross does, we've seen book after book and it's getting very tiresome and irritating.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He always gets matched up with an attractive woman in law enforcement ( how many of these can there be?!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't think I've ever seen any in real life! ) who he starts falling for.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He's always saying he needs to stay home more often, then runs off for days on end on another case, leaving his family high and dry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is especially irritating in this book because The Mastermind is threatening his family throughout, yet he keeps leaving to pursue this case and leaves them alone with their 80-year-old grandmother and no other protection!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When the Mastermind calls and again threatens them, he acts as if he's forgotten they were in danger and calls in his trusty buddy Sampson, who rushes over and watches out for them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Come on, Cross, your kids' mother was violently murdered, you're all they have left and you're taking off when they're in danger and endangering yourself?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've always liked Cross's character in the past, but he got on my nerves here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"5. The plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is the dual plot of The Mastermind and the vampire killings, the last of which is solved with a'who cares?' near the end of the book to concentrate on The Mastermind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The dual plot isn't interwoven enough to make it work.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Plus, where Patterson usually writes believably about investigations, this one has some very unbelievable leaps of faith.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cross finds that some magicians are performing in the areas that the murders were committed, and, from that alone, they brand them the killers and are able to get a huge FBI team to follow them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hmmm...a little more evidence would be good here!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was saving the best ( and by best I mean most maddening ) thing for last.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the end of Roses Are Red, The Mastermind is revealed for who he is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In Violets Are Blue, we go throughout the entire book with him still being called The Mastermind as if we'd never been informed of his identity!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The author drops clues to his identity which are completely and utterly ridiculous because WE ALREADY KNOW WHO HE IS!! What was he thinking here?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Did he forget we knew who it was?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He seems to be insulting our intelligence by bringing him back in as an unknown, thinking we're not smart enough to remember that we already solved this little mystery in the last book!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ugh!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To make matter worse, he's revealed in dramatic fashion like we're supposed to say,\" OH!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My goodness, who would have guessed?\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course, we're not surprised and Cross doesn't seem too surprised either.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Considering this is the plot that he runs with in the end, it's very disappointing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now that I'm done ranting and raving ( believe me, I could have done more but I restrained myself ), would I recommend this book?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, if you're an Alex Cross follower, you might as well read it because you're probably already hooked ( as I am ) and will want to read the next one ( which there almost certainly will be--why not if he can get away with marketing this amateurish crap and still stay on the bestseller list? ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, if you can get out now, do it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Patterson seems to be going down the toilet and bringing his faithful fans along with him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Wow. Stephen King trying to write a fantasy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's like Britney Spears trying to rap, or Backstreet Boys trying to write a good song.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's just not going to happen A medicore fantasy would be the best of his ability, but of course there would be bloody killing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Basic fact of life: I don't like the author.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I despise Stephen King, so if you love him, as in you would be offended if anything bad was said about your author, then I suggest stopping here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I mean, he's not even that good, and he's got all these terrible best selling novels, I'll just say that he struck it rich with the\" thrills and chills\" crowd that likes their children to read R.L.

wish.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Peter--The ONLY well-developed character in the book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I hated his guts, of course ( if he existed, I would.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunatly, he has no guts to hate, so I guess it was a bad choice of words ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Naturally, hes the good looking good guy that you know will always win at the end, but you just dont know how.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The first son of King Rolands, hes destined to be the Prince, but of course the exact same evil plot to stop that from happening happens, just as in any copycat novel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sigh.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thomas the choo choo train--Okay, just Thomas.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have to say I despised this character also.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The second son of King Roland, hes always overlooked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course, with his birth, the Queen Sasha died, so the first thought is that he is the bad guy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thats partially true, actually.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, his tragic birth was made possible in part by the evil wizard, Flagg, giving Roland an overdose of crack.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( Okay, maybe not crack, but the same kind of stuff.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Green vodka.","target":"Genuine

count them off now ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The evil wizard Flagg--GASP!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Your typical, demon wizard set to take over the

Butler.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He finds the dead body of a rat, and that s basically his huge involvement in the book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unless you would rather me spoil the ending?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Plot","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cough....cough....uh, let's see.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A fat little king named King Roland was not a bad, dictator king, but a good hearted king.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A good heart, we soon learn, does not help you much in life when you are trying to be the oh-so powerful king of this little land.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"His main advisor, whispering his every move into his ear, is a black cloaked wizard named Flagg who is sooo unsuspectable when he gives King Roland this green gunk and we later find out his wifes been killed by it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Such a nice guy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What an unpredictable plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yippie doo!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, after deciding Thomas looked sexier than Peter, he decided to frame Peter for killing daddy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He shows Thomas an eyehole, where you can peek through the eyes of a dead dragons head, through the wall, to spy on dada.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, after King Roland flashing the dragon while Thomas is looking through the eyehole, Thomas decides to go back (you horny man, you ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, he sees Fragg giving Roland an evil drink, and Fragg devises a clever(? ) plot...poison Roland and poison a rat with the same stuff ( it makes smoke come out of your ears and it makes your body suddenly go up in a green fire, maybe you ve heard of it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I heard listening to the Backstreet Boys may cause it ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, put the dead rat in Peters room behind a bookshelf, and let Dennis find it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Typical, typical, typical.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I do not like this plot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Do you?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Getting bored

vulnerable pieces of cr@p that wont matter in three months, while these great writers never get their fair share of the pie.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its always like that is nt

Fantasy VIII sold millions of copies when it s the most boring game Ive ever played, and Monster Rancher 2 pretty much barely made it past the price they paid to make it and it s a wonderful

this one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Im not sure if you liked Pet Cemetary or whatever, but just pass on this shallow plot, and go get The Doomsday Book by Connie Willis for a much better plot and writing talent","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It won't be any spoiler to the literate masses to say that this classic Gothic horror story revolves around young Doctor Victor Frankenstein and the monster that he brings to life.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This unnamed creature, the culmination of years of painstaking work by Frankenstein, turns murderous after experiencing cruelty and persecution in his every encounter with humankind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mary Shelley's work was first published anonymously in 1818.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Significant in its day for the distillation of Gothic literary conventions combined with an original and imaginative premise, the book is still widely known today, if not quite so widely read.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was fairly surprised to find that I did not at all enjoy reading this book.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fact, I found it enormously repetitive and tedious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Despite the brevity of the story, I still thought the story dragged on, as if the author had padded the story heavily without adding anything of substance.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was also surprised to find that the story held absolutely no suspense for me, nor could I say that the story struck me in any way as\" creepy.\"","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Sort of a disappointment for one of the most famous Gothic horror stories of all time, wouldn't you say?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Adding insult to injury were the leaden dialog, a completely unsympathetic main character and the lack of credibility in the actions and thoughts of the characters.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Here's an example of what I mean when I say the dialog is leaden.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The scene is one in which a household servant of the Frankensteins has wrongfully been accused of a murder committed by the monster.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The excerpt is typical of all the dialog in the novel:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" She is innocent, my Elizabeth,\" said I,\" and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.\"","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"\" How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She wept.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Dearest niece,\" said my father,\"dry your tears.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.'","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"#NAME?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But it strains credulity to suggest that intimate family members would really converse with each other in this way, no matter the era.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After endowing his creation with life, Victor Frankenstein flees his laboratory, loses track of the monster and then goes about his miserable life for two years, apparently uninterested in what has become of his life's work.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is this plausible?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"His role during this time consists principally of languishing in nervous fever-wracked states, absolving himself of all responsibility, wallowing all the while in self-indulgent, morbid melancholy and revulsion towards the work of his own hands.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He waffles and dithers and generally acts like an idiot for chapters on end.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"None of this behavior endeared him to me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, the monster possesses qualities, at least at times, that are far more ennobling than any his creator ever displays.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The words\"miserable\" and\"misery,\"\"gloom\" and\"anguish\" appear on almost every page, sometimes in multiple paragraphs per page.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If Shelley was trying to get the message across about Victor's wretched state, she might have had a little more faith in her readers' ability to absorb that message the first, second, third or fourth times around.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Or barring that, she might have had recourse to a thesaurus to look for other descriptive terms.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The reader is asked to not only endure, but to care about and empathize with the neurotic thoughts and behavior of Victor Frankenstein for far too long.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet another implausible aspect of the story creeps into the narrative by way of the narrator.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Frankenstein is actually a story within a story within a story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What that means is that Victor Frankenstein is relating his story to the captain of an exploratory vessel in the Arctic, who is in turn taking the tale down in lengthy letters to his sister.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And when Frankenstein recounts the story told to him by the monster, yet another layer is added to this tissue of boredom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I digress.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What I found implausible here is the highly favorable impression that Victor Frankenstein - at this point a dying wreck of a man - makes upon the sea captain.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In his letters, the captain speaks of Frankenstein's nobility of soul and of how he grows to love the good doctor as a brother.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Knowing Frankenstein through his own words left me with an altogether different impression of the man and I fail to see how the captain could be so taken with his acquaintance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has been and can be argued that Frankenstein is largely a moral tale.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To reduce the moral philosophy of the tale to its essence, kind treatment makes people good; cruel treatment, revulsion and rejection makes them wicked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet this idea doesn't even hold up in Shelley's tale, for Victor, though raised by benevolent and loving parents treats his own creation most cruelly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And the monster, though treated most cruelly by all he encounters, retains an innate moral compass and yearning towards goodness even as he continues his annihilation of Frankenstein's friends and family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another theme that Shelley raises but does not satisfactorily treat is the idea that man's desire to master nature and to understand the world in which we live is futile without the all-too-rare qualities of self-mastery and understanding of human desires and limitations.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Frankenstein's fatal immaturity allowed his hubristic faith in his own abilities to overreach his wisdom and his compassion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The monster is not inherently monstrous, but becomes so through his creator's rejection of him.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Had the young doctor had the wisdom to predict his own reaction to his creation or the compassion to treat it benevolently, Shelley suggests, the disaster could easily have been averted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet this message is merely hinted at and not drawn out to any clear explication or moral.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's clear that Shelley meant to play upon the parallels and contrasts between the creator and the creature in her novel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each of them is made miserable by the existence of the other.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each of them seeks to master the other.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both feel cut off from the world around them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And they both say of their sufferings\" I bore a hell within me.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet their differences are great too, for where Victor pursues science and rationality in his studies, his reactions devolve into hysterics and passivity; while the monster, who comes into existence with no learning and no one to instruct him, resorts to empirical analysis of the world and consistently acts vigorously on the basis of his analyses.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In these contrasts and similarities, we can detect Mary Shelley's background as the daughter of a philosopher and the wife of a poet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, this after-the-fact sort of literary parsing doesn't make up for the anemic and long-winded text that Shelley left us.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is the first time in my memory that I have read a classic piece of literature and found virtually nothing to commend it or repay my time and effort.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It surprises me that a book of such a reputation falls so far short in every way by which I am accustomed to judge fiction.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sadly, I cannot recommend this book to anyone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I suspect that the book continues to be read today largely on the strength of its popularity in the era of its publication","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've read most of the books written by Mary Higgins Clark and have enjoyed them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before I Say Goodbye is her 22nd book and my least favorite of all of them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I just felt her other novels were much more exciting and interesting.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I read the back cover of the book and expected something completely different than the story before me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The synopsis indicated that Nell MacDermott had lost her husband, Adam, when a bomb blew up his boat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She had so many unanswered

positive"},{"sentence":"Maybe Clark's publicist was trying to draw in those interested in the paranormal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The story was more based on Nell trying to clear Adam's name when bid rigging and construction scams are investigated by law enforcement agencies and her husband's name seems to be at the center of it all.","target":"Genuine

well described, but only vaguely outlined.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That's probably the biggest detriment to the book - there were so many support characters that could have made for some fantastic subplots and the opportunities were wasted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, Nell's Great Aunt Gert could have an entire book devoted to her whimsical character.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She's fun, eclectic and loves to explore the supernatural ( didn't Mary Higgins Clark write an entire book for another support character with the

Gert, which should be fun to read.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before I Say Goodbye is an average book, but definitely not on the top of Mary Higgins Clark's list of great

what her fears were, and used these fears against her.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I feel that this book was very unrealistic due to the fact that Susan was a physist, yet she was not a spy and I have no idea why the KGB would be that interested in her.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If Dean had continued with the same storyline that was introduced in the beginning and the middle, the book would have been much easier to read and believe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead, he took a perfectly good story, slapped on a fancy ending-that did not go at

to the other major problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I, for one, didn't really care about the dilemma.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I worried about the fate of the human race if those dinosaurs managed to escape from Jurassic park.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I didn't worry that this highly skilled woman was going to lose her job ( Oh the horror of it all )!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Or that a Chinese ( the new\" Evil Empire'? ) would steal an American wing design.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Less important but still distracting from the story is Crichton's habit of throwing his own prejudices and political beliefs into his stories.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Beside the'Evil Empire' we get a one sided view of the'Evil Media' and a terrifying portrait of the'Evil Union'.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm not a fan of today's media with it's'sound bites'

personnel ego.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I find that hard to believe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm also not a fan of unions with mostly short term, selfish goals.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But still, this story would have us believe that the union would take any opportunity to seriously injure or even kill a middle aged single Mom who has nothing to do with their actual grievances, just because she is part of management.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"No way Mike!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I DO like Chrichton.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And there were a few riveting moments in the book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It might even make a good movie since the movies tend to cut out all the technical stuff anyway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Compared to the work of more competent practitioners of the art of the globe-hopping action/adventure/mystery

may leave the reader with a sense of wondering what they just read.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Clancy's stories are always extremely intricate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are usually multiple subplots going on in the background of the main story, and they are usually brought together by some climatic ( and often catastrophic ) final event.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In\" Debt of Honor,\" Clancy doesn't deviate from this proven formula.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"All of his most familiar characters are present, and they all become entangled with different problems ( which are all linked together, in typical Clancy fashion ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Debt of Honor,\" focuses on a rising conflict with the Japanese, and it's a problem that most likely would never happen in reality.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The book is a very long, slow read, and there is often too much dead time between the action.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Clancy has always written this way, but he usually is able to fill the dead time with political activities and insight.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In\" Debt of Honor,\" Clancy unfortunately focuses on a part of the government that is foreign to most people - economics and the stock market.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A good economist would probably be able to make sense of most of the eco-jargon, but the average reader will find himself wanting to skip a lot of pages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Debt of Honor,\" is the weak link in the Jack Ryan story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For those wanting to follow the exploits of

though, shows how desparate James Patterson must be to keep churning out cheap thrills in order to make a buck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also shows how repetitive his ideas are.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From one Alex Cross novel to another, the same theme revolves, but within different circumstances:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Alex Cross

explain why.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the child murderer is some nerdy kid who stopped taking his anti-depressant.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This second storyline seems to have been added just to add extra pages to the weak first storyline.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One last thing that bothered me is that the book was written around

this cotton field represents the many dark secrets held throughout.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each little boll of cotton could be one secret, with the whole field turning out to be hundreds and hundreds of well-kept secrets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This book is set in the early 1950's on the cottonfields of Arkansas.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What else can I say about the plot?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, one thing's for sure, it takes a HELL of a lot of time to get to the plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had to read about 50 pages before I could find out just exactly what the point was.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once I got there, I discovered that an innocent boy by the name of Luke Chandler was the main character.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the early stages of the book, Luke and his father ( or grandfather, I can't remember ) go out and look for workers to pick the cotton.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They look for Mexicans in particular since they are more likely to work for lower wages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In any case, the beginning stages of the book were like walking in waist-high mud.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was boring, tedious, and dull.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I felt like I had to force myself to enjoy the book at this point, which should NEVER be done while reading.","target":"Genuine

hour.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Interesting, and I did chuckle a few times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But chuckling was rare in this book.","target":"Genuine

a little attracted to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luke also meets many other people ( mostly people who were hired by his grandfather to work the cottonfields ) who either befriend him or show hostility.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't wish to reveal much else about the plot because I don't think it is worth mentioning.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's as simple as this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luke Chandler is a seven year old boy who encounters new people on the cotton farm who either like him or don't like him.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Regardless of whether they like him or not, Luke is forced to keep many secrets the workers have told him or made evident to him.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The rest of the story drags on, there are a few murders here and there, with rarely a laugh, if none at all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bottom line is this: If you're used to John Grisham's court justice books, DON'T read this one.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's way off-topic compared to his others.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are interested in a story from the 1950's and cottonfields and the hostility between workers, then you may want to pick this up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I find that the story is just too dull for me, though, and that's why I'm giving it a 2 stars out of 5.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bought and read\" A Painted House\" as soon as it came out as I do with all John Grisham books.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was interested to read how he treated a story that did not revolve around a legal case.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He did not treat it well, and I will not buy another one of his books unless it is a legal thriller like his others.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The setting of the story seemed interesting enough--a rural Arkansas farming town during the Korean War.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The story takes place over the length of a cotton-picking season.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is an observation of the picking season as told by a seven year old son of a sharecropper, Luke.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luke's character is very well developed, and his is the only character that is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are many other characters in the story, but the reader is never given enough information to really care about them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The weak character definition made for a long and boring read, as I really didn't care what became of most of the characters in the story.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The book was a very long read.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The one redeeming quality was that it was very descriptive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had clear visuals of what the characters and the town looked like.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The descriptive nature of the story, however, was not enough to make this an interesting story.","target":"Genuine

church and high-tails it for the Vatican to relate this unholy confession to his'superiors'.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fast forward, and skip across'the pond' to Washington D.C. where

about.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Case is able to do this without being dry - at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Perhaps its because he too knows what he's talking about.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The mini-bio found in the insert tells the reader that\" John Case is the pseudonym of an award-winning investigative reporter and the author of two

it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Was it even possible?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"  CHAPTER 1","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So begins The Genesis

turns and comes to a stunning and unexpected climax.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was very close to the final chapters before I realised the full magnitude of the scenario that was being presented to me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are a few holes  in the plot ( why does nt the baddy just shoot the goody in stead of talking at him and then letting him escape? ) but these seem irrelevant as the roller coaster ride across two continents charges along.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The hero, Joe Lassiter, is the head of an investigative agency.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When his sister and nephew die in a house blaze he joins the investigation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over the next 437 pages, he becomes increasingly ensnared in a world populated with assassins, medical experimentation, secret societies, arson, the church hierarchy, myth and mysticism, and multiple murder.","target":"Genuine

detail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would not wish to give away anymore of the plot but regardless of your beliefs, convictions and persuasions, this is one book that will challenge them all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would agree with the quotes of the cover from Norman Mailer ( [It ] is one of the few science-mysteries I have read that is impeccable in plot, immaculate in story resolution and moves with high skill from locale to locale and from suspense to suspense ) and Stanley Pottinger ( A week after I finished reading it, I still woke up at three in the morning wondering: What If? ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I completed the story six months ago and I too still wonder ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is the best book I have read for many a year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A Painted House is not so much a novel, or even so much an attempt by John Grisham to write the Great American Novel, as it is a memory picture, a long last look at a childhood in the rural South in the 1950's.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A Painted House is lovingly narrated by young Luke Chandler, age 7, as he looks back across the span of years at the eventful harvest season of 1952 in Black Oak, Arkansas.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The initial problem confronted by Luke Chandler and his family is one of economics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the good economic times we've had in this decade, we've forgotten that economics is usually described as a\"dismal science\", and dismal is one word that describes the fortunes of the Chandler family farm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The situation is so simple that the seven-year-old is easily able to grasp it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Family patriarch Eli Chandler has taken out his annual crop loan to pay for the cost of renting the land and running the farm through the growing season.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Come harvest time, all eighty acres of the cotton crop must be harvested and taken to the cotton gin.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cotton is the lifeblood of the farm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If it rots in the fields, if floodwaters shoud wash it away, if the cotton brokers up in the sinful city of Memphis conspire to lower prices, the Chandler family faces mounting debts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even if there is a bumper crop of cotton, that'll tend to lower prices and yield less income.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And if, somehow, the harvest is a success, it will only mean a few more luxuries, and the chance to do it all over again next spring.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This may make the novel sound grim, which is not the case.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The economic realities of cotton farming primarily serve to highlight the social realities of cotton farming, which the novel addresses from its first sentence.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even with the best good will in the world, Luke and his parents and grandparents would never be able to pick 80 acres of cotton by themselves.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Work must be hired in order for the harvest to come in successfully, and in northeastern Arkansas, that means\"hill people\" and Mexican migrant laborers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The South has always had a class structure, enough so that one wonders if Karl Marx wasn't really born in South Carolina and wasn't fooling those folks over in Europe.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Chandlers are somewhere in the middle; as Southern Baptist tenant farmers, they're below the Methodist shopkeepers in town and above their sharecropper neighbors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( We don't meet any African-Americans until later in the book; Grisham claims that blacks were rare in that part of Arkansas, and I don't have any way to know if he's cheating. )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Pentecostal hillbillies and the Catholic Mexicans rank towards the bottom of that structure; Luke's mother feels the need to remind people from time to time that the Mexicans are human beings, too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( In case you're wondering, the people at the very bottom of Southern class structure are Yankees, and people who root for the baseball Yankees aren't much higher on the list. )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But it would be wrong to characterize A Painted House as a story of class struggle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The conflict between the hill people and the Mexicans is just one of a mosaic of conflicts that the novel lovingly illustrates.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Grisham shows us the divisions within the Chandler family itself; shows us the endless quiet turf battles between Luke's mother and grandmother over the kitchen and garden, the long twilight struggle of Luke's grandmother against her ornery husband, and the problems left behind by Luke's hellraising Uncle Ricky before he went off to war in Korea.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even the title represents an intergenerational conflict between those who want the Chandler's house to be painted for the first time and those who don't see the need.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"On top of those conflicts, Grisham presents the ancient divisions between town and farm, between man and weather, between boys and girls, between innocence and experience, between North and South, between the Cubs and the Cardinals.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( It is to Grisham's credit that Stan Musial and Harry Caray are characters as important as any other in the novel. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The conflicts that Grisham creates are all fairly obvious from the start, all the more so because the characters in the novel are close to being stereotypical.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( The Claude Rains Principle applies here; stereotypical characters in a John Grisham novel?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm shocked, shocked. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The nice thing about A Painted House is that it presents and resolves these conflicts in such a leisurely manner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Far from being a thriller, A Painted House moves at a slow, unhurried pace that is entirely appropriate to the subject matter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In meteorological terms, although Grisham sets off the odd tornado here and there, the real tension builds up like slow-moving floodwaters rising in a valley.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What moves the novel along, surprisingly, is not so much the Grisham talent for storytelling but an evocative, almost lyrical style and a stunning talent for observation and recollection.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luke Chandler doesn't have much dialogue in the novel -- in fact, most of the story involves him keeping his mouth shut -- but his descriptions of life in rural Arkansas are wonderfully detailed and insightful.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Details such as the acts at the town carnival, the Chandler patriarch's theory on the proper speed to drive a pickup truck, the types of ice cream available at the Baptist church picnic, and a thousand other little gems are one of the reasons that the novel sparkles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here's Grisham on a small, but telling subject:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My worst chore of the late afternoon was in the garden...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was on the east side of our home, the quiet side, away from the kitchen door and the barnyard and the chicken coop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Away from Pappy's pickup and the small dirt drive where the rare visitor parked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was enclosed in a wire fence four feet tall, built by my father under my mother's direction, and designed to keep out deer and varmints.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Corn was planted around the fence so that once you closed the rickety gate with the leather latch, you stepped into a secret world hidden by the stalks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My job was to take a straw basket and follow my mother around as she gathered whatever she deemed ripe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She had a basket, too, and slowly filled it with tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, peppers, onions and eggplant.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She talked quietly, not necessarily to me, but to the garden in general.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"\" Look at the corn, would you?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We'll eat those next week.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Yes ma'am....\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My mother loved this little plot of soil because it was hers -- no one else really wanted it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She treated it like a sanctuary.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When the house got crowded, I could always find her in the garden, talking to the vegetables.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Harsh words were rare in our family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When it happened, I knew my mother would disappear into her refuge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I thought very highly of A Painted House, unfortunately, I am unsure that my appreciation of the novel will necessarily be shared by everyone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The biggest attraction that A Painted House had for me was that it allowed me to draw parallels between my own childhood experience and that of the protagonist.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't grow up picking cotton, thank goodness, but I did grow up poor and Southern Baptist in Mansfield, Texas.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was the son of a preacher man, and we lived on the parsonage of New Hope Baptist Church in 1974, with a big garden where my mother grew okra.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My father preached every Sunday and spent the rest of the week working in a scrap metal yard to make ends meet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We didn't live there very long, and ended up moving into a house trailer on the extreme fringes of Dallas County, where my father pastored another struggling Baptist church before he left the pulpit for a teaching career.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I remember all of that, remember what it was like growing up in a trailer park, and how it felt to move into a real house of our own for the first time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And I thought about my great-grandfather, the first Curtis Edmonds, who was born in Alabama almost 120 years ago, and who assuredly did pick cotton there, and on a dirt farm near Milford, Texas, and on another farm in Archer County.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I thought about what he would think of where I live and what I do for a living.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And I thought about my little nephew, and the advantages that he has, and will have, and how alien and far away the world that Grisham describes will seem to him when he grows up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I hope that he will read A Painted House, and think about it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You wont find any lawyers or courtrooms in John Grishams newest novel, A Painted House.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"No sireebob, this is a horse (or, house ) of a different color.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It seems the attorney-turned-publishing commodity has reached the point in his career where the annual publication of an automatically-bestselling legal thriller is, perhaps, getting a bit old-hat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What we need here, folks, is something completely different to revive routine bloodsomething like, oh I dunno, a coming-of-age tale told by the seven-year-old son of an Arkansas cotton farmer; something without legal eagles; something with only sporadic thrills; something to show the world that even though Grisham writes airplane-ride fiction, he secretly pines to be accepted as a serious literary author.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its a risky move.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most members of the Rocket-Propelled Bestsellers Club ( Tom Clancy, Stephen King, Sue Grafton, et al ) rarely stray far from the well-cropped pastures of their established genres.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even when King goes legit ( Different Seasons, Hearts in Atlantis ), there remain shades of darkness and monsters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, you ve got to admire a fellow like Grisham who tosses the dice with a book like A Painted House.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Will he disappoint long-time fans expecting more Southern-fried justice?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Will he recruit readers who would nt ordinarily pick up a paperback where the words # 1 Bestseller  dominate half the front cover?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Will Clancy decide to jump in the fray by writing a bodice-ripping romance?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Only time ( and a blitz of hype from Grishams publisher ) will tell.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I should mention that Ive never read any of Mr. Grishams other books ( not even on long airplane trips ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Im only familiar with his works by way of Hollywood ( ranging from the horrid A Time to Kill to the excellent The Rainmaker ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, while I cant tell you how A Painted House compares to The Brethren, Im happy to report it s a cotton-pickin good read on its own merits.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It will never reach solid gold classic status like Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird, but it does bring to life a time, a place and a set of characters who burn bright in your mindat least until you turn the final page and move on to the next book waiting patiently on your bedside table.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A Painted House is the story of a single harvesting season in the autumn of 1952 when the Cardinals are trailing the Dodgers by five games ( baseball, that easy nostalgia tool of writers, figures prominently ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The narrator is pint-sized Luke Chandler, the only son of Jesse and Kathleen and grandson to Pappy and

novels with his first release, A Time To Kill.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nothing compares!!! Some have come close to that greatness, but not many.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I enjoyed this novel and Grisham even had me laughing at one point in time with Tally and Luke as I mentioned above.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The biggest disappointment would have to be the end of the novel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It leaves the reader drawing a blank and wanting to know what else happens to the family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Personally, I feel that Grisham may have done this for a sequel maybe at some point in time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He may not have intended to write a sequel, but if enough of his fans love this style, maybe he will write a follow-up novel to the Chandler family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Who knows?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is just my opinion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are looking for a nice change of pace, pick up A Painted House and enjoy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I personally feel this is one of Grishams best in a very long time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I must start out by saying I have never read a John Grisham novel until now...gasp.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I've watched the movies, but never read any of the books.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A novel without all the lawyer intrigue appealed to me, so I gave Grisham a shot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He truly does know how to tell a story, but this one needed something more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The novel takes place in the rural cotton farming country of Arkansas in the 1950's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Little Luke Chandler and his family struggle through another tough picking season with their hired hands.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rest of the Chandler family includes Luke's mother and father ( who secretly want more from life than farming ), Luke's pappy and grandmother ( who could never think of doing anything but farming ) and Luke's uncle Ricky ( who is off fighting the war in Korea instead of starting trouble in his hometown ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luke is a bright 7

negative"},{"sentence":"I don't want to give anything away, but a dangerous man in each of these two groups start alot of trouble on the farm and in town.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Trouble that ends in death and destruction.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other big point of intrigue in town revolves around a very poor share-cropping family called the Lathchers that live nearby the Chandlers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Latchers have a full house of shoeless hungry children that Luke's kind mother takes food to on a regular basis since it is the\" Christian thing to do.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When the eldest Lathcher daughter, Libby, is rumored to be pregnant, the ladies in the Baptist church society put Luke's mother up to the task of finding out if the rumor is true and who the father is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After many trips to the Latcher shack, Luke's mother and grandmother are asked to help deliver Libby's baby.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The birth not only rocks the lives of the Lathcher's but the Chandler's as well.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The two families are forced to come together when a shocking secret is revealed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for the title of the book, it revolves around a rather small portion of the story and is hard to quite understand the significance of it all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The youngest Spruill child, Trot, who is handicapped in some way takes a liking to Luke's family and begins painting their unpainted home ( this is not a give away, it is made very clear in the book and is no mystery ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The symbolism of this act is rather hard to get to the bottom of, but makes for a cute side story and helps end the novel...if you want to call it an ending.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ending truly leaves you hanging and it's not in a good way.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I wasn't left wanting more, I just felt cheated by how it all ended.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was made to care about a few of the characters in the novel, but was not allowed to know what happened to them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"At times there is much repetition in this novel, especially when it comes to the cotton picking scenes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just wanted to tell Grisham that I get it already, they're picking cotton, it's hot and it's hard work.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For several chapters he uses the same wording to describe different days in the field where the same things happen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It just felt like dead space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The intrigue that involves murder, illegitament children and strange house painting is intersting, but I never felt on the edge of my seat.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My major complaint about these aspects of the novel is that there was never any real mystery involved.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The answers were handed to me instead of me searching for them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead of giving choices of who killed who or who the baby's daddy was, they were made obvious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't like when writers hold back important information, but I felt like it didn't need to be all laid out so plainly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Especially with reading a Grisham novel I expected more mystery and intrigue.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also felt at times that he wrote Luke a little too intelligent and resourceful for his age.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just don't believe that a 7 year old boy in rural Arkansas circa 1952 could really have some of the thoughts, feelings and actions that he did.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yet the novel was still an enjoyable read and took me to a time and place I had never really thought about before.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The characters are well plotted out and the dialouge is written well, there are just some unbelievable moments.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's worth a read, though, so give it a try.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could not put this book down.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I bought this book before heading out on a 2 day bus trip back to one of the states I grew up part of my life in, grand Montana!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It took 2 days to get there and I really dislike Greyhound and if it were not for the cheap ticket price I would never take it anywhere.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I knew the trip would be scenic but there would be times that I wanted to get away from it all and settle into a good novel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, this one did more than let me settle... I took me by the\"tie\" and jerked me under!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just could not stop reading it, the plot of all his books are the best of almost any writer out there.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He and Michael Chrichton are among the best I have ever read.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This book was about a lawyer who worked in a firm as a litigator and was around the most defiant and high up men there were in the city.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He had it all, money, car, a beautiful wife, till one day a homeless man came and crashed it all in front of his eyes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It goes from his high life to one of the lower society where he becomes a street lawyer after being fired from his job at the large firm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And goes from there into a suspensful plot and great writing techniques conjure up all kinds of a perfectly attuned story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This writer knows his business, he can take you from fear, to trust and back again in the blink of an eye.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have never been able to stay in a book so long since the Hardy Boys, haha!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you're up for a good read that will have you constantly wanting more and getting it sooner or later, than heres your author and heres your book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Go grab one from the local newstand now...you will not be un-satisfied!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Tell em the most avid John Grisham reader in the USA told you to come, and they will know what to get you:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First of all let me say that I am a die hard Grisham fan and I am a Mississippian, but I have to tell you that I was very disappointed in this book to begin with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is very far removed from most of JG's work and I was not prepared for it!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The story - seeming almost autobiographical - focuses on a seven year old boy\" Luke\" and his family the\" Chandlers.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luke was born and raised in the cotton fields and at seven years old he picks almost a hundred pounds of cotton a day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Farming the Delta is not an easy thing and we learn through this tale that even a good harvest can be doomed!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The passages were very descriptive and interesting for the most part.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the story, Luke is witness to racial tension, the birth of his illegitimate cousin, the murder of a local bully ( out behind the cotton gin ) and the murder of a field hand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are no court room scenes as he never tells anyone but his grandfather what he has witnessed and Grandpappy deems it\" their little secret.\"","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Life in the Delta was tough and the passages are nostalgic in the descriptions of sitting on the porch in the evening heat listening to the ball games and dreaming of being a Cardinal Baseball player one day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lukes mother dreams of a better life for her and her family and I hope that they got it - and I would have appreciated finding out - but the ending is rather open and leaves many questions...like what happened to Uncle Ricky - did he make it back from the war?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Did he give his child his name?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Did Luke and his family find the\" good life\" after they moved north and did he ever get that Cardinals jacket????","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is an interesting book if you can look at it with out expecting the Grisham\"law and order\" style.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But given the content, this is one I would have gotten at the library instead of spending the money for the hard back for my Grisham collection.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am a slow reader, but compared to my husband, I'm a veritable Speedy Gonazalez.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He starts a book and, if he's really interested, he finishes it three weeks later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So when he finished reading The Da Vinci code in three days, I was impressed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" I couldn't help it!\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"my husband said.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" It just sucks you in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I started and before I knew it, I was halfway done.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You should read it!\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was surprised.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While my husband is fully supportive of my book habit, he rarely goes down the\"you should read it\" path when it comes to his books that he likes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"His attempt to get me to appreciate Tom Clancy ended in loud snores on my part.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The covers of his many sci fi books all seem pretty much the same to me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And I am rarely tempted to snatch one of the books off his\" to read\" pile and sneak it into my own.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, with the exception of some classics from Tolkein and C.

conventional clues ( like footprints in the flowerbed, lipstick on the collar, and fingerprints on the wine glass ), the mystery follows a trail of riddles and symbols.","target":"Genuine

book!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I enjoyed it because many of the clues involved two of my favorite subjects: art history and theology.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"According to a one-page intro, The Da Vinci Code involves actual groups and historical events.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Catholic Church, which has enough public embarrassments to make it a viable topic for any mystery novel, and Opus Dei, which received much attention due to FBI spy Robert Hanssen, figure prominently into the plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Toss in lots of talk about the Priory of Sion and Leonardo da Vinci's use of symbolism in his art, and you have a conspiracy theorist's wet dream.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This leads to my one caution about this book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Da Vinci Code presents some alternative interpretations of religious history and involves paganism.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ultra-conservative Christians ( or those who aren't secure in what they believe ) may want to steer clear of this one.","target":"Genuine

priceless historical artifact.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ive always liked books that invite the reader to solve puzzles along with the characters, and Code has them in spades: anagrams, numerical cyphers, riddles, and secret scripts ( at one point, a character offhandedly comments that at least 62 other words can be made using the letters of the word PLANETS, and I had to stop reading and try it out for myself ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The puzzles range in difficulty from Instantly Obvious to Unsolvable Without Being Fluent In Greek.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Theres also plenty of historical information, which is integrated smoothly into the prose; remarkably, even when inserted into dialogue, the explanatory asides dont interrupt the flow.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Brown ensures that readers who are unfamiliar with religious iconography and cyphers have all the necessary information to fully enjoy the story, without leaving advanced readers feeling bored or patronized.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Even if you know all this stuff already, the authors concise recaps are interesting and, as far as I can tell, well-researched and factually accurate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Brown s writing is clean, precise, and detached, conveying information efficiently and minimizing its narrative presence in the story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The plot is appropriately full of twists and turns, with plenty of cliff-hanging action and a highly satisfying resolution, although some of the inventions seem a bit much ( not only must there be a self-mutilating monk/assassin, but he must be an albino self-mutilating monk/assassin to boot ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The character development is pretty much what youd expect from an action-packed thriller  which is to say, minimal, unless it provides an excuse for more ass-kicking adventure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The focus is upon the ingenious puzzles-within-puzzles that Brown has devised, rather than the characters who try to solve them; for this type of story, that s not a problem, although it does limit the book to entertainment rather than literature.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A fast-paced, suspenseful, and surprisingly intelligent thriller, The Da Vinci Code deserves its good reputation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its fascinating, action-packed, and itll do more to stimulate your mind than an overpriced mocha at the Terminal B coffee cart.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If youre ready to let your powers of deduction take flight, give this first-class airport book a try.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although I purchased The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown almost two months ago, I just got around to reading it last week.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would have liked to have read it sooner, but unfortunately I had\"prior commitments\" ranging from work-related projects to Harry Potter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I became interested in the book after reading the book flap which made the plot seem like it was about the exploits of this secret club made up of the intellectual heavyweights from the last five hundred years.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While my initial assessment was not totally off, I was both surprised and pleased to find out what the book was actually about.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The book contained so many plot twists and spoilers, but I will try my best not to ruin anything.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The plot centers around Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology at Harvard who is in Paris to deliver a lecture.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As the story begins, Langdon is summoned to the Louvre during the dead of night to see a rather peculiar sight.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of the curators, Jacques Saunire, has been found murdered; not only has he been found dead, but the manner in which he was found is also peculiar.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Immediately, Langdon must evaluate his role in the murder because it quickly becomes apparent that Saunire left behind clues to help Langdon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Langdon is aided in his quest by Sophie Neveu, a young cryptologist who has an interesting connection to the case.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You might be wondering what this\"quest\" entails and you might be surprised to find that Langdon and Neveu are not out to find","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Saunire's murderer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As it turns out, that is the least of their problems.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead, Langdon and Neveu must follow the clues that Saunire left before he died and embark on what can be best described as a scavenger hunt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Their work is complicated by the fact that they have the police chasing them and they are racing against Saunire's murderer, an albino monk named Silas, a member of Opus Dei ( which is a prelature of the Catholic Church ) who has been sent to recover the same thing that Saunire was trying to protect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seems that Saunire was a member of the Priory of Sion and it is up to Langdon and Neveu to find whatever it is the Priory is hiding before Silas does.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They will have to use their skills to follow the clues that have been left for them and look for help from the few they can trust in a crazy race against a mad monk.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If the plot sounds complicated, I can assure you that it is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, one must keep in mind that I just summarized a 450 page book in one paragraph.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The reader starts out not knowing anything and slowly, over the course of the book, more and more is revealed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As the story progresses, it forks off into three distinct storylines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first follows the perspective Langdon and Neveu on their quest, the second follows Silas the albino monk and the third follows Bishop Aringarosa, an Opus Dei bishop who is traveling to the Vatican and seems to be giving Silas his orders.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found it a little frustrating to have these three storylines - every time something good was about to happen with one storyline, the chapter would end and the perspective would switch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This didn't make me like the story any less nor did I find it hard to follow - the frustration I felt stemmed from wanting to know what came next!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Although it seems that nothing makes sense, things slowly begin to come together.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition to providing a first-rate action-adventure/mystery, Brown also introduces a series of fascinating theories about everything from art to history to religion and how all three are related.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I must point out that very few ( if any ) of these theories are original, their appearance in the book serves as really great plot twists and Brown has woven a fascinating story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because many of these theories are treated as plot twists, I don't want to give too much away.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I know that I personally was shocked and fascinated by many of these theories and if I had known about them in advance, I don't think they would have had the same effect.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Of course, I would also like to pique your interest, so here goes: before the patriarchic religions appeared, goddess worship played a large role in religion but this dissipated over the years.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Or did it?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What if the Priory of Sion was devoted to goddess worship and had control over the secret of the most powerful relic in the history of Christianityand that's just the beginning.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Frankly, the book flap doesn't do the book justice.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is much more than just a book; it is an experience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are a fan of art history or history or conspiracy theories or fictional mysteries, then Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is for you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This book is very hard to put down but it is well worth reading.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You will not be disappointed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have recently discovered that Brown has written another book that features Robert Langdon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can bet your bottom dollar that that book is at the top of my reading pile.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I highly recommend The Da Vinci Code.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The curator of the Louvre is murdered in his museum and leaves a cryptic message that appears to point to Robert Langdon, a symbologist from Harvard, as the culprit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The police question Langdon pretending to need his expertise but really hoping to catch him in a lie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In jumps Sophie Neveu, a police code breaker who warns Langdon of his danger and forces him into an escape from the museum.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Turns out, Sophie is the murdered curators granddaughter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She knows Langdon is innocent and needs his help to crack the messages left to her by her grandfather.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What follows is a bizarre romp through Paris and England as the unlikely pair elude the police, a vicious albino monk, and the true puppet-master who orchestrated it all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Da Vinci Code is a classic thriller with an intellectual bent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fact and fiction are woven into such a tight pattern of conspiracy that it becomes difficult to see where one ends and the other begins.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It had me running to my art books with some astonishment, and the history generally rang true.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first chapter is immediately engrossing and hooks the reader from the very first sentence.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rest of the story fails somewhat to live up to the potential offered in that first chapter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The plot follows a rather traditional pattern in the modern thriller, and though it has been done again and again ( if you are around writers for any length of time you will discover that there are no original plots ), the perspective offered in the tale is fresh enough to be thoroughly enjoyable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are good reasons this novel is on the bestseller list.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are a few things that detracted from this story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first was Brown s over-reliance on two constructs of the fiction writer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When he needed to get across a lot of background information ( and there is an enormous amount of it ), he did one of two things.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He either had Langdon flashback to a lecture he gave in a class somewhere (yawn ) or he had two or more characters discuss the issue to death.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fiction writers often refer to this as maid and butler talk  because it s like the maid and the butler discussing the going s on of the family when they both know the going s on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is about as thrilling as watching paint dry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other thing that was a disappointment was when the author withheld information from the reader.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I presume this was to create tension; all it managed to do was create aggravation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For instance, why keep the secret ritual in the basement that had Sophie so upset from the reader?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He kept that from us until near the end.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The characters also needed some help.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the exception of the albino monk and the police chief, the characters were too good for their own good, and failed to react in a believable manner to the situation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No one had a nervous breakdown, no tempers flared.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If it was me being interrogated by the police and someone barged in, took the bug the police planted in my jacket and tossed it into a moving truck thereby making it look like I was running, a fugitive, and therefore guilty, I think I might be just a little peeved.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, the layout of the story, the imminent danger they kept finding themselves in, and the amusing aspect of the puzzles carried the book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am looking forward to more from Dan Brown.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Enjoy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I saw The Da Vinci Code advertised on my local television station and I had to give it a try.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is, without a doubt, the best book I have read in at least two years, and DEFINITELY the best book out right now.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The novel focuses on Langdon, a Harvard Symbology professor, who has traveled to France in order to receive an award or attend a conference or something ( I honestly don't remember what brought him to France ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He called on by the French police in order to give his opinion on a recent murder.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The murdered also happens to be a curator for the Louvre Museum in Paris, and he also happens to be a man that Langdon was scheduled to meet with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The reason behind this scheduled meeting is one of the many mysteries to be revealed as you read through the book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't want to give much of it away, because the book is written in several\"phases.\"","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Although the entirety of the story takes place within just over 48 hours, each phase reveals more information, and slowly the story unfolds hour by hour ( and I mean that quite literally ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The murdered man leaves behind a puzzling code, and as the reader you really find yourself pondering the code.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first code leads to a second code, and so on and so forth...and as the book progresses you find yourself trying to solve the codes, it really keeps you hooked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once you figure out one code, suddenly you're thrown into another phase of the book, still puzzled with the mysterious happenings that you are reading about.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This book is wonderfully written and is so obviously well researched that I found myself amazed at the small details.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They say to write what you know, and Dan Brown's knowledge of the early church, art and history really shines through in this tale.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It sparks a lot of thought, and is such a good conversation piece...especially for those of us who have a lot of interest in the history of the Church and its controversies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the book was engaging and an overall fast read, there were a few minor\" complaints\" on my part.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many of you will feel as if the writer is underestimating his audience, in that some clues are so very obvious to the reader, you can't help but want to smack the main characters aside the head to give them a clue.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Many times I found myself thinking something, and then putting it aside because it seemed bit too obvious, or even far fetched at times, then a character will pipe up with the same idea and suddenly it all clicks into place.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, I don't recommend this book if you are looking for a novel with a lot of character development, the bulk of this book is spent on explaining events in history, theories, and describing controversial opinions on many areas...there isn't a lot of character development.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fact, I think the best developed character was the English man, a\" supporting role\" if you will.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In that sense, you don't feel as if you\"know\" Robert Langdon by the end of the novel.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I also felt there was sort of a minor problem with an underdeveloped sub-plot ( I won't give it away, but we know what sub-plots usually involve ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Other than that, the book is definitely a must read, and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a problem reading about the controversial issues regarding the truth of the Church.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you haven't read about non-traditional Church history already, the book may actually be a slap in the face.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"John Grisham is one of my favorite bestselling authors, and I have read almost all his books.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This one was certainly different from the rest of them in my opinion, in both good and bad ways.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the negative side, it was not as suspenseful and fast-paced as, say The Pelican Brief or The Firm or his other courtroom dramas - when I read them I could scarcely put the book down for fear that something was going to happen between the pages in my absense.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However on the positive side, this book contained a much deeper message than those other books did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( Which probably explains why it wasn't all about write-an-awesome-story-to-sell excitement. )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The story begins when a bum walks into a rich firm and holds ten attorneys - including some of the best and richest in the firm - hostage in a little room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He has dynamo strapped to his body and is holding a gun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He asks one lawyer to give him the facts straight of the IRS reports: how much money have each of these big-time lawyers donated to charity?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"By charity he doesn't mean the local symphony or the high-up charities they give money to in order to get their name mentioned, but money given directly to the poor homeless people on the street or the soup kitchens, free clinics, homes, etc. that help them out?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Of course the lawyer can't give a very big figure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although no harm results from this short hostage-holding-session ( except to the bum, who is shot by a sniper outside and whose brains explode all over the lawyer who was assisting him with the figures ) and it seems like the bum was just trying to make a point instead of really hurt anyone, and although the rest of the attorneys go back to their strenous trying-to-get-on-top schedule, the laywer who was asked to tell the bum the statistics is deeply touched by this episode and wants to find out more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lawyer's name is Michael Brock, and he becomes the main character of the story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although he is a rising star at Drake and Sweeney, the law firm, he gives up some of his billing hours to investigate this incident.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This decision leads him to helping at a free clinic and donating his time at a homeless shelter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When he finds out what connection the firm has with the bum, he leaves it, and takes along with him a stolen file.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From then on, he is a crook, and a street lawyer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This book wasn't only another good John Grisham tale, but a touching story of a man who realized his life had been shallow and he wanted to make a difference.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I recommend it with this reason.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want a fast-paced court-room drama, read another of his books first.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But if you are tired of that sort of thing but what something different and deeper, read The Street Lawyer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Janet Evanovichs series of books starring Stephanie Plum, an inept bounty hunter, was one of the most enjoyable books Ive read in a while.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Things get moving right away, with everything happening to poor Stephanie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, I found myself laughing out loud many times while reading this book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Stephanie has some problems that have cropped up over and over in all the books in this series:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She has too many hormones  and they make her lust after two men: Joe Morelli, the cop who shes known since childhood, and Ranger, the super sexy, dangerous and mysterious bounty hunter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both men seem interested in her, and shes not too sure what to do about it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In this book, however, she does nt seem to get much chance to do anything, even if she wanted to.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Something keeps happening to her cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only car Stephanie can seem to keep undamaged is Big Blue, the big old boat of a car that her grandmother lets her drive when she is out of a vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Stephanie became a bounty hunter when she lost her job.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She is absolutely not qualified, but the boss is her cousin.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Usually, she gets the easy jobs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But this time, her boss wants her to go after Ranger.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No dummy, Stephanie absolutely refuses, even though that means her archenemy Joyce will get the job instead.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Stephanie has a whole new set of problems now.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, Joyce is convinced that by following Stephanie, she will find Ranger.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some other people also think Stephanie will lead them to Ranger, and if not, she can be used as a hostage.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Everywhere she goes, these men are following her.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She comes up with some interesting methods of ditching her followers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of the skips she is sent to bring in keeps trying to kill her.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( By the way way, that s the naked guy with the plastic bag on his foot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She finally had to shoot him. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She has more problems with the all of her skips.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Stephanie also winds up with two unwanted and uninvited roommates: Grandma Mazur and a dog named Bob.","target":"Genuine

get a good nights sleep, because either Grandma is snoring or somebody is breaking into her house and waking her up.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And, of course, she just has to find at least one dead person, and be attacked at least a few times to keep things moving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This book brings in two new characters who are sure to become as popular as Grandma Mazur.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mooner is a bond skipper who she was sent to pick up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He keeps popping in and out of her life, and is a total stoner, dude.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He shows up in the middle of the night to drop something off, having picked the lock so he would nt disturb her.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dougie the Dealer is another new friend she inherits through Mooner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No, Dougie does not deal drugs ( except Metamucil ), but he does deal in everything else.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He helps Stephanie a bit in this book, and even sells her grandma a red Corvette.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If it s not one thing, it s another for poor Stephanie.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She just cant get a break.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you like a good laugh with your mysteries, this is the book for you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I suggest reading these books in order, but if you start out with this one, youll be able to follow whats going on without knowing the background of the other books.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was nt sure what to expect with Hot Six,  the first of Janet Evanovichs Stephanie Plum novels that Ive read  although it is not the first book in the series.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Im still not sure what the significance of the title is but I do know that all the Stephanie Plum novels have titles with numbers in them; the next book after Hot Six  is Seven Up. ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In any event, Hot Six  is a delightful laugh-out-loud story of bumbling bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, who plies her trade among the common crooks in Trenton, N.J.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even as she finds and attempts to apprehend bail jumpers, she deals with a variety of personal problems that include a spunky grandmother, a policeman/boyfriend, a mysterious man who pushes all the right buttons on Stephanie, and a large zit on her chin.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She also has very bad luck with cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ms. Plum is around 30 years old and does nt give much of a description of her looks, but she must be among the better lookers to justify the attention she gets.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The book starts with Stephanie talking an old female acquaintance down from jumping off a bridge, telling the would-be jumper that her body just wont look good in a dress when it s found  wearing slacks is the right way to dress for this particular form of suicide.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Her first bounty-hunter case is to track down the Mooner,  a drugged-out modern-day hippie who manages to avoid work even as he takes lifes ups and downs in stride.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mooner simply forgot to show up for his court appointment  as if he could ever remember  and peacefully goes to the police station with Stephanie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While there, he manages to torch Stephanies car but cheerfully offers to find her another car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The next case is Morris Munson, who failed to appear on homicide charges.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He proves easy enough to find but much more difficult to snag, and there is much comedy as Stephanie and friend try to corner Munson.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But the most intriguing case is that of Carlos Ranger  Manoso, who taught Stephanie her trade as a bounty hunter and who is now wanted for questioning in regard to the murder of a local mobsters son.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is something going on that does nt smell right with this, and both Stephanie and Ranger work to gather information on the case.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Meanwhile, Grandmother Mazur moves in with Stephanie, turning Stephs sex life upside down and banishing her to the couch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Various people, from Ranger to Munson, break into Stephanies apartment as she attempts to sleep on the couch, keeping her tired and grumpy through the day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Grandma Mazur wakes up only at the end of the activities, complaining that Stephanie is running a nuthouse with all these late-night visitors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then there is her boyfriend, Joe Morelli, a vice cop with the Trenton Police Department.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even as he gets increasingly frustrated that there is never a quiet moment to spend with Stephanie, she becomes an important conduit for information between the police and Ranger.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Stephanie is feeling the frustration too, but youre never quite sure if it s Morelli or Ranger she lusts after.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I had the feeling that either would make Steph happy, if only Grandma Mazur would nt stick her nose into the wrong place at the wrong time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Finally  as if she did nt have enough going on  Stephanie is saddled with a large omnivorous dog named Bob, who becomes the um, butt of many of the books jokes.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And this book has LOTS of jokes, many of which are laugh-out-loud funny.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a fine  and mostly unexpected twist  at the end and the book came to a satisfying conclusion, leaving many smiles in its wake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a very fun story that should be enjoyed by any fans of Sue Grafton or Sarah Paretsky novels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, Hot Six  is considerably wittier than those other fine novels and Stephanie Plum is a more sexually straightforward character than V.

crap.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With that said, I have nothing against Ford or the Taurus for that matter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, the fact remains that the auto giant made very few ( if any ) improvements over the 1999 SE model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I, in fact, have a sneaking suspicion that the company has gotten a bit too comfortable in the market and in the buying public.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They have a built-in audience that will buy a Ford Taurus regardless of higher quality and similarly priced competition ( like my own lovely 2002 Chevrolet Impala LS ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"THE EXTERIOR","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From the outside, the 2002 Taurus SE looks pretty good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The style is a definite improvement over the late 1990's'spaceship look.'","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It in fact is a combination of the more popular earlier and boxier Taurus lines and the style popularized a few years back by creative Japanese auto manufacturers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The side panels are relatively blah, while the back and front are slightly attractive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ford designers should nt be proud of their work on the car, redesigned initially for the 2000 model year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As with the 1999 model, the vehicle has some issues with aerodynamics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car should have been tested further in the wind tunnel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, if you drive one and haven't yet noticed rode grime and mud collects in strategic locations toward the back bumper.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its not a major issue when you're driving but goes to show that the body isn't perfectly designed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"THE INTERIOR","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Upon sitting down in the bland medium-gray interior, the first thing that struck me was that it looks and feels cheaply made.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Considering the fact that the car retails for over $ 20K, this is nt a good thing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are strange metallic decorations, a badly contoured dash, and not in the least bit attractive console.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Fortunately for Ford, the console is nicely arranged and can be accessed easily by the driver.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's roomy enough for a mid size vehicle, though the seats aren't nearly as comfortable as some other similar vehicles.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The already uncomfortable seats have no features to speak of.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can tilt the back and push the seat forward or backward.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Aside from that, the 2002 Taurus SE lacks lumbar support and any of the other perks that are sometimes

drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Taurus SE on the other hand feels like a dog.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The usually adequate V6 Vulcan with 155 horsepower engine is slow to accelerate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The automatic shifting at times has problems between 1st and 2nd gears adding to the already problematic driving experience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once you get up to speed, the car functions decently, though not perfectly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Passing is a laborious

my Impala ( with a much larger engine ) that's not too good.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That larger vehicle gets about 25 miles to the gallon on average.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Taurus' smallish engine should in reality be more efficient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, basically, you get a low energy car with iffy gas mileage.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is this car sounding good to you yet?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I hope not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"FINAL ASSESSMENT","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When compared to the earlier style model, the 2002 Taurus SE looks nicer from the outside though it took a big step back with the interior.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At well over $ 20,000 for this car, it s not a good buy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would recommend buyers look elsewhere to the aforementioned Chevy Impala, the Honda Accord, the Toyota Camry, and even the Chevy Malibu before settling on the Taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It really is a disappointing vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was given this car as a company vehicle when I first arrived in the US 2 months ago.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My first thought on seeing it was\"what an ugly heap!\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was more impressed by the luggage space as it fairly easily swallowed all of the stuff a family of 4 carry when travelling to a new land.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Driving from the airport to the hotel I was immediately struck by how soft the seats were.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Almost sofa like in comfort if you only travel for a few miles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Problem is that for longer journeys they are completely lacking in support and I was in agony after only 50 miles or so.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Next nuisance item was the multifunction stalk for controlling lights, wipers etc. Really, these functions should be seperated but the use of a column gear change prevents that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These column mounted gear stalks are very quaint, but personally if I never see one again it will be too soon.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Performance was, well how could I put this without cussing, absolutely useless.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That thing couldn't pull the skin off a rice pudding.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is flatter than roadkill and only slightly more attractive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know its top speed as I never felt sufficiently in control to test it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It felt like it would have trouble outrunning a moped but I never had the courage to try it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Brakes are adequate without being startling.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I did find that parking brake to be hopeless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anybody living in a hilly area is going to become rapidly hacked off with not having a normal handbrake rather than the stupid foot operated system.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is impossible to gradually release a foot system so making fully controllable getaways a distant dream.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nope, not on this thing!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is the sort of softly suspended barge on wheels American cars used to be like.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This might have been acceptable in 1975, but things have moved on a long way since then.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My last 3 cars were 2 SAABs and an Audi A4 so perhaps criticising the handling is a little unfair.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Problem is that Ford's offering in this category in Europe is the Mondeo and it kicks bottom!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now that is a car they should be offering to the American public, rather than the shoddy heap of garbage that is the Taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You'd never see me buy one of those but I drove enough in a rental car to make myself a good opinion.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Quite silent at highway speed except for tire noise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling is not too bad and healthy, body roll is contained, brakes are strong enough in spite of the absence of rear discs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Seats have absolutely no lateral support, which makes driving on twisty roads a real pain.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Auto gearbox 4th gear is way too long, engine lacks torque to hold it unless road is flat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Steering mounted gear lever is clumsy although it saves space for stuff between the seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Upshifts are okay although not without hesitations at low speeds, but downshifts are slow.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Build quality is really average to low, I had the steering lock mechanism coming out inadvertently.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plastics quality and assy leaves to be desired, we are far, far away from Audi-league.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well lets get right to the point I was a big owner of Taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have own practicly all models except this one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Taurus has always been on the cutting edge for technology and power over most manufactures cars that are comparable to the taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of the main reasons why Taurus made it into the nascar races because Taurus was building a name for themselves of making powerfull cars. in 1995 Taurus came out with their ultimate car which was the 3.8liter v6 SHO taurus folks let me tell you if you ever get a chance to ride in a 3.8 liter v6 SHO taurus do so because the minute that person lays his foot on the pedal your jaw will be in the back seat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why am i bringing this up because this is all important do to the fact how ford taurus has progressed into a awesome car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That i kept buying because each year they kept getting better and better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then all sudden the ovals came out and a smaller taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then next was the smaller engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"when i ask the manufacture if they have more engine packages he said no 3.0 is it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Come on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So i forgave them and look into the interior i wasn't impress it wasnt up to par with the typical norm of ford taurus in the pass.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was cheap material.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hole dash board layout is totaly illogical.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It came with a cassete deck has default and no cd player.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm sorry but cassete deck built into the dash.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cassete deck shouldnt even exist anymore in the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I praticlly laughed my head off when i saw this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"ford most still be living in the 1980's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most foreign cars if not all come standard

where the fingers would normally be.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"who in the world came up with that idea they must have been smokin somethin.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The spedometer totally sucks also you cant tell what the heck speed your doing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"theirs more lines and dashes then their are actuall speed listings so you have to study the damn dash to figure out what speed you are doing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The console cup holders arent big enough.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sterring on the car seems like it has a huge understeer to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It almost seems like you have to turn the wheel around 5 times just to get it to do a square corner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the passanger side their is abosultey no place for you to lay you feet down flat.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When you sit down your feet are always propt up on something.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And of course i could go on with the list.","target":"Genuine

negative"},{"sentence":"o and the trunk size is decent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"thats it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"O just though of another bad the sound system in the car is terriable its really tinney sounding and the radio stations sound really far away when their not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ford has ruined the Taurus and this model i will not buy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It breaks me heart to say this but i will probably not by another taurus until i see improvement.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I will be heading over to the toyota series of cars now.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because it seems like the foreigns have more innovation and techonolgy in their cars now.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ford is still living in the 1980's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And i do beleive when they came up with the ideas for this new series of ford taurus that they must have been smoken something for sure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mitsubishi Lancer is all new for the 2002 model year, replacing the cute, yet infamous Mitsubishi Mirage.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the Mirage was a cheap car made with cheap materials, its successor boasts only slight quality improvements at a much higher price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the commercials may have young trendy adults singing to' Barenaked Ladies' and seeming to have a great time with this car, I have come to the conclusion that singing along to trendy rock tunes with the Lancer's 100 watt stereo system may be one of this car's only fun attributes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For 2002 the Mitsubishi Lancer comes in 3 trim lines, the ES ( my tester ), LS, and OZ.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All trim lines come with a 2.0 SOHC 4-cylinder engine that pumps out a lackluster 120 horsepower at 5,500 RPM, and 130 lb-ft of torque at 4,250 RPM.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Power is distributed to the front wheels via a standard 5-speed manual transmission, or a 4-speed fully automatic transmission ( as was in my tester ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Note: If you plan on buying the sport model'OZ' Edition don't plan on getting any better performance than with the base models.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The OZ has the same 120 horsepower 2.0 4-banger mated with the same transmissions.","target":"Genuine

acceleration mated with the 4-speed fully automatic transmission came, at first with slight hesitation, and then with needed patience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine and exhaust noise is slightly isolated from the driver, but no better or worse than say a 1997 SOHC base modeled Ford Escort.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Compared to its predecessor; the Mirage, the 2002 Lancer ES does seem a bit zippy, but this out-right performance is far from blowing my skirt up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the 4-speed automatic transmission is somewhat smooth, it is probably not the best pick for this SOHC 2.0 set-up.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'd recommend going with the 5-speed if you must choose this car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While not exactly'super fun', handling in the 2002 Lancer ES is well balanced and surprisingly sporty.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Despite the heavy curb weight, and the small wheels and tires, I never felt that I was going to lose control on the twistys, nor was I conscious of this car's relatively hefty curb weight while driving.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Body roll is minimal, and the steering is excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cruising in this small sedan is also good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The suspension, while being sporty, also allows for a comfortable ride while cruising at high speeds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Bumps and rattles can be present on certain road surfaces, but this usually is not too annoying.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Wind, engine, and road noise do play a factor at high speeds as with most economy cars, but this should only aggravate the most picky of drivers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hills are taken fairly well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 4-speed automatic will shift down into 3rd gear on almost any incline, but the ride remains calm, and the engine doesn't get as loud or as fussy as with some car's engines in this class while accomplishing these sorts of tasks.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Braking is average.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Lancer ES comes standard with front wheel disc/rear drum brakes without ABS.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Despite this cost effective, health hazard set-up, the Lancer stopped with little effort and felt more like a 4-wheel disc set-up than the dinosaur set-up which it was equipped with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fuel economy is a little disappointing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The EPA rates this car with an automatic at only 31 MPG during freeway driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This EPA is almost 10 MPG less than the EPA ratings for the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Engine Gripes: If Mitsubishi is going to charge this much cash for their cars, they are going to need to pay much more detail to their powertrains.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"SOHC engines in expensive cars, or even sport oriented cars are not at all desired.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"More technology, DOHC designs, including VVT would be welcomed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mitsubishi needs to stop spending so much money on their fancy commercials and start investing this money on making some good cars like they once did, i.e the Mitsubishi 3000GT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Interior Accommodation:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have read a few reviews on this car over at www.cars.com,","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and despite many reviewers saying this car has the interior set-up of the 1980s Chrysler K cars, it is nowhere near that bad, but the interior does leave a lot to be desired.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior, while very dated does have a functional design and easy ergonomics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The drivers position is also very good which offers great vision in all directions, and easy access to the instrumentation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the convenience package, and even without it, amenities are plentiful for a car in this category.","target":"Genuine

sound system is clear, but no Bose by any means.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The convenience package adds some items such as cruise control, and 60/40 split bench rear seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"www.mitsubishi.com","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"has more info on all standard and optional equipment that can be had for the ES and other Lancer trim lines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The front bucket seats are a major complaint, I found them hard to the'butt touch', and offered little back support.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Lancer ES's cargo and storage is adequate at most, the trunk is small, but there are plenty of pockets in the cabin for small items, like broken knobs etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Exterior Innovation:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The exterior of the 2002 Lancer is really nothing to write home about, but it's no ugly duckling either.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Mitsubishi played it pretty safe with the styling of this small sedan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I do like the front fascia, as it offers a chrome grille, and an'open mouthed' front bumper which adds a little more sexy modern appeal to this otherwise blase'get lost in traffic' car.","target":"Genuine

Warranty:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For 2002 the Lancer ES with a manual transmission starts at around $ 14,000, however, with options, such as an automatic transmission the price quickly rises to near $ 17,000 as was my tester's sticker price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mitsubishi has never been known for their reliability, however it has been improving, if anything does go wrong with your 2002 Lancer, Mitsubishi offers an'average' 3 year, 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty, and a 5 year, 60,000 mile powertrain warranty.","target":"Genuine

complained.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"During the first year, the car performed well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Electronics worked well, engine was strong, etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, after the 1 year mark hit, little things started happening all at once: Driver window would not slide back up without an initial KER-KLUNK, bulbs began blowing out, the lighter quit working ( not the fuse ), and the engine, in spite of professional maintenance, began to sound ill.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I know there are better alternatives in this class and I'd suggest you save your money on this one, unless you want a vehicle full of problems long before the notorious 3 year mark.","target":"Genuine

positive"},{"sentence":"The new Eclipse GT continues the Galant-platform front-wheel drive coupe' ethos of the Eclipse, but without any real sporting edge.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Instead, the current top-end Eclipses are basically family sedans with a body kit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Platform cars can be good - witness the top-end Golf-platform Audi TTs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Eclipse however makes too many practicality sacrifices for appearance, and too few for performance.","target":"Genuine

performance and cornering thrills can be obtained from a cooking Mazda MP3  saving the driver $ 7,000, and gaining in rear seat room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While arguably resisting understeer better than some older Eclipse front-drivers, the inherent lack of grip of the FWD drivetrain simply doesn't work when married to an overweight platform, and soft springing that exacerbates weight transfer away from the drive wheels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In short, at anything other than a straight line, in the dry, wheelspin dramatically limits any attempt to make progress.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Civic DXs will blaze past when there's standing water.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cornering in the dry on stock rubber similarly brings out the lack of corner-exit drive, and a sinking feeling as applying power has the nose of the car heading for hedges and low-flying pedestrians.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And while queasy, low-speed four-wheel drift feels fun in a Subaru Impreza, two-wheel drive wheelspin impresses no-one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So as a performance vehicle, the Eclipse is a lousy effort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"FWD performance cars have to be light to get around their weight-and-power distribution handling disadvantages, get that power to the road, and avoid dangerous and irritating torque steer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example: the Civic Type R; the Renault Clio

VR-17s, the car works quite well in straight line cruising.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car wont tramline noticeably, and its soft, reasonably damped suspension is effective at insulating the driver from poor road surfaces.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the nose of the car will push horribly wide and is difficult to place accurately ( even absent throttle-understeer ) in sub-50 mph cornering, the steering setup gives a strong on-center feel with considerable stability, and the vehicle will track straight with a bare touch  or none - on the wheel.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In faster corners, the car is pleasant and predictable, like a good mid-size family sedan, though the V6 needs attention to stay in the upper reaches of the rev-range if meaningful drive is to be made.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Brakes feel powerful, if slightly over-servod at low speeds ( like most cars ), but above 70mph are less good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Worse, the soft springs encourage the back to pass the front if hard braking is attempted from high speeds, especially on mild uphill inclines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though some reviewers complain about the engine note, people who like the sound of a V6 will find it pleasant around town.","target":"Genuine

options, it s a good GT in the classic mould.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its a heavy car, with handsome looks, an engaging ( if not over-powerful ) big-hearted engine, a good ( factory option ) premium sound system, a solid feel at the controls, and good long-distance comfort and decent luggage space for 2.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As such, it s best for munching miles in comfort, rather than attacking racetracks, backroads and highway on-ramps.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But if you want to spend the money on that, why not stretch a bit further, and get a 325ci  a machine that delivers quality, luxury, handling, highway manners and looks to beat the Eclipse, for a small amount more.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And if you like performance, youll more likely prefer either the raw uncontrollability of a true modern muscle-car, or the precision and ability of modern compacts like the RSX or Impreza.","target":"Genuine

pickup.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Xterra has always boasted rugged, chunky exterior styling, but the front end treatment lacked the edgy quality of the rest of the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now a more aggressive looking front fascia adorns the Xterra complete with round, almost oval shaped headlights, and a honeycomb type grille.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Xterra is much more in keeping with how one might expect an off-road capable SUV to look.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior has a sportier look as well; separate round, backlit gauges and a slightly more stylish center dash give the Xterras interior a youthful look.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Xterra is now available with a supercharged V6 making 210 hp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This a welcome addition as the normally aspirated V6 in the Xterra and Frontier makes a barely adequate 170 hp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The supercharged engine in the Xterra is a first in its class.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The main advantage the Xterra has over its competition is size.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nissan calls the Xterra a compact SUV and it is the least expensive SUV offered by Nissan with prices starting at $ 18,000 for a 4-cylinder 4x2.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However similar in price, the Xterras interior and exterior dimensions literally dwarf the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, Land Rover Freelander, and Subaru Forester.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Only the Hyundai Santa Fe comes close in terms of interior volume and overall size.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Physically, the Xterra is more similar to mid-size SUVs like the Toyota Highlander or 4 Runner than any compact SUV.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cargo room in the Xterra is plentiful, fold the split rear seats down and there is even more room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rear seats fold down easily, but do not fold all the way flat, a feature most other vehicles in this class have.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you still cant fit all your gear inside, the Xterras sizable roof rack can accommodate almost anything.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Xterra seems purpose built for exterior mounted, aftermarket travel containers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the rear seats folded up, there is more than adequate room for adult passengers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although there is plenty of leg room, there seems to be precious little foot space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nissan uses a type of theatre seating  wherein the rear passengers sit slightly higher than the front seat occupants.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its a great idea, but an unintended consequence is that rear seat passengers cannot get their feet to slide under the front seats.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Therefore the back seat feels more cramped than it really is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Front and rear seats are average in comfort  many Nissan cars and truck have comfortable and pleasant seating positions, this is true of the Xterra as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rear seats do not recline, but seem to be in a permanent partial reclining position.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Some passengers like this, others thought it felt odd.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Xterra also has the competition beat when it comes to towing capacity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"An SUV based on a truck rather than a car may not offer a smooth ride, but boy can it tow.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With a towing capacity of 3500 lbs., the SE S/C Xterra can out-tow virtually every vehicle in its class with the exception of the Jeep Liberty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In many cases the Xterra is able to handle from 1500 to 2800 lbs more than other SUVs like the Ford Escape and Hyundai Santa Fe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you must have 3500 lbs towing capacity AND the ability to traverse rugged terrain, the Nissan Xterra has you covered.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But if you want a decent handling, drivable family vehicle with a civilized ride, then scratch the Xterra off your shopping list.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Xterra is a body-on-frame vehicle  in short, it is a truck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most body-on-frame vehicles are not known for their refined highway manners, but the Xterra is probably the worst of the worst.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Chevrolets Tahoe and Suburban utilize body-on-frame construction and the ride on those vehicles is actually quite pleasant.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even the smallest of pot-hole or uneven pavement upset the Xterras ride.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This truck squirms and shakes and shimmies like nobodys business.","target":"Genuine

rattles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When unoccupied,the passenger seat-back vibrates back and forth terribly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rough roads are cause for concern as the Xterra often felt like it was dog-tracking  or driving slightly sideways whenever uneven pavement or large dips were encountered.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its difficult to keep in just one lane, and the steering is vague and incommunicative.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I often felt like I was in danger due to the fact that the Xterra would rarely respond the way I expected.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On straight, smooth roads the Xterra has a tendency to wander.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Constant input to the steering wheel is needed to keep this truck on the straight and narrow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only plus in the handling department is the Xterras relatively small turning radius, this proved helpful in tight parking lots and garages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the 210 hp is a welcome addition to the Xterra, the vehicle does nt seem to be able to effectively handle that much power.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"During hard acceleration, the Xterra would lift and twist and end up pointed in some direction I never intended.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Even thought he Xterra is a rear-wheel drive vehicle, it felt like it was suffering from front-wheel drive torque-steer  as this is with the 4-wheel drive disengaged.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Acceleration is better than average, but lacks the brute force expected from a 3.3L, supercharged V6.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 6 does take a few seconds to catch its breath, but once the supercharger is really pumping, there is a noticeable surge forward that only seems to grow stronger as the revs climb higher.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maximum output is at 4800 RPM.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is bit of whine from the supercharger once it gets wound up, it s hardly intrusive, but still noticeable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even with the 210 hp, the S/C Xterra could still use a few more ponies, even the normally aspirated Altima 3.5 makes 30 more hp than the supercharged Xterra.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, the supercharged Xterra offers more power than vehicles such as the Mazda Tribute V6, Hyundai Santa Fe V6, and Toyota RAV which is only available as a 4-cylinder.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The much pricier Toyota Highlander with a V6 makes only 10 more hp but can cost thousands more when ordered with a few basic options.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Bringing the Xterra to stop is drama-free in most cases, but in panic stop situations, the Xterra nose-dives terribly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In heavy traffic, low speed short-stops are common.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In this situation, the Xterras brakes feel touchy and the vehicle rocks back and forth once it comes to a full stop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rear brakes are drum type  are they kidding with this thing?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Who wants to pay as much as $ 27K for an SUV with drum brakes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can understand it on the $ 18,000 4-cylinder version, but not on the supercharged 4x4.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Other problems with the Xterra included: outside window molding with excessive gaps, disconcerting rattle from under the vehicle when driving ( even at low speeds ) on rough pavement, excessive play in the steering, no vanity mirror on either passenger or driver side sunvisors, and a passenger's seat that squeaked constantly whenever it was unoccupied.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Finally, due to the Xterras weight ( 4229 lbs. ) and its thirsty supercharged engine, fuel mileage is a miserable 15 mpg city / 18 mpg highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This puts the S/C Xterra in league with a bigger V8 powered SUV like the Chevy Tahoe which makes 75 more horsepower.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you value fuel economy, opt for the Xterra XE with the 2.4L engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I used a half tank of gas in just three days of normal commute driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes the freeways in Los Angeles are crowded, but my office is 8 miles away from my home.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Add a few side trips to the store or lunch and that still does not equal a half tank of fuel gone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Overall, the 2002 Nissan Xterra XE S/C is a mixed bag, but the bottom line is that I simply can not recommend this car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Granted, it is a stellar off-road performer and can tow more weight than almost all others in its class, plus holds a bunch of cargo inside and on the hefty roof rack.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But the shortcomings are just too much to overcome.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A vehicle like the Land Rover Freelander has a lot of negative aspects to it as well, but at the end of the day, it is a car that most people could live with and enjoy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A rugged, good looking truck, the Xterra is just that, a truck  and a sloppy one to boot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Car based SUVs offer superior comfort and drivability, but lack the Xterras truck like qualities  both good and bad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Expect retail pricing on the Xterra to start at $ 18,000 and run all the way up to $ 27,000 for a 4x4 SE supercharged V6.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyone looking to spend $ 27,000 or more on an SUV should seriously consider the Nissan Pathfinder, Mazda Tribute, Toyota Highlander, or Chevy Tahoe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unless youre running the Paris  Dakar rally, skip the Xterra.","target":"Genuine

the end of the month, there wasn't anyone among 4 different dealers who could find a 2002 Maxima SE with the right combination of options and color that I wanted in California or Nevada.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's the problem with option packages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unless you want to special order and wait, you are going to

by the car magazines, newspaper supplements and professional car reviewers, so I will focus on the shortcomings and design flaws.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why?","target":"Genuine

Chinese water torture, a few small things, over a period of time can drive you crazy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And there are a lot of small things that taken together make for an annoying experience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"IMO, Nissan has cut a LOT of corners on the 2002 Altima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This might be acceptable to meet financial constraints in a 15-20k car, but is inexcusable in an approximately 30k ( list ) car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Perhaps the mistake that Nissan has made is to try to bring the car upscale too fast by offering the expensive 6 cylinder model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the 4 cylinder econo-car class, the Altima would probably be a very acceptable package priced at say 19-22k max.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Were I in Nissan management, I would not have offered the 6-cylinder model leaving that to the Maxima

stability control does not cut in too early, unlike most such systems.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But the TL Type-S remains less than eager to turn in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It lacks the tossable feel present in a BMW 3-Series, or even in my lowly Ford Contour.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Strangely enough, Ive noticed the same problems in the Oldsmobile Aurora and Cadillac Deville.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is possible that channeling a ton or power through the front wheels has its trade-offs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Maxima and I30 will be similarly powerful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Im now eager to see if they will have the same problems.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of this is nothing compared to the ride.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its just plain awful, worse than anything Ive driven in recent memory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Type-S reacted sharply to just about every imperfection it encountered in the road.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I thought my Contour SE, with a very stiff suspension, rode poorly, but driving home from the dealer I suddenly realized that the ride just sounds bad; you hear more than you actually feel while hitting bumps and potholes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the Acura these were both heard and felt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If anything, the ride resembled that of a 1980s GM sedan with the performance suspension option.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Back then, GM thought that a performance suspension had to ride like hell, and those in its sedans did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Given the degree of jittering I sensed, I suspect that the TLs structure is also more flexible than most in this class, further degrading the ride.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, the Type-Ss ride felt inappropriate for this class of car, and perhaps for anything short of an all-out sports car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If this translated to phenomenal handling, it might almost be forgivable, but it does nt, so it is nt.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"All of the competition rides better, and most of it handles better as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Update: Xorg in his own excellent review says that the hard ride I experienced might be caused by overinflated tires.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They ship at 40 psi ( as is standard practice for all cars--reduces bouncing on the rail car and truck ) and sometimes the dealers forget to deflate them to 32 psi.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wouldn't expect this to make that large of a difference, but it would certainly make some difference.","target":"Genuine

brains...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Only a test drive with a tire gauge would really solve this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At any rate, when you test drive this car be sure to have the tire pressure checked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It might significantly affect your evaluation of the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Update 2: I still have not driven a second TL-S, but based on comments from owners in Autoweek and a review in Consumer Reports ( Feburary 2002 issue ) I suspect that my evaluation was not based on overinflated tires.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"CR is meticulous about setting tire pressure accurately, yet complained about a\" jittery\" ride, even on smooth surfaces.","target":"Genuine

unconsciously, they reject any evidence that this car might have some weaknesses.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sorry to burst your bubble.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Last Words","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A 260 horsepower engine and 17 performance tires do not a BMW killer make, even if the price appears to be amazingly low.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The basic car, derived from the Accord, is simply not up to this mission.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Given the pattern of the cars faults, Im beginning to wonder if Honda hired all of those engineers that took early retirement from GM in the early 90s.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Flinty ride, torque steer, overly fake wood, flimsy structure, an attempt to cover all of this up with great statstheyre all here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its a shame, because the world really needs a great high performance sedan for around $ 30,000.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is anyone listening?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Till then looks like the best bet is a used 3 or, for less money but also less refinement ( sometimes chassis imperfections are fun ), a Nissan Maxima","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My neighbor bought one of these, the sport model.","target":"Genuine

First off the colors they offer....blech....to make a cheap product look nice they should offer something nicer than maroon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"NOt to hurt my neighbors feelings even when they thought they had bought a top of the line product I just kind of shrugged and said it was\"nice\".","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My first thought was, morons, should've bought an Odyssey or a Windstar or even a Quest.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think that most people that buy the Villager really want a Quest but just can't afford one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So my neighbor took me for a spin in her new van.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The door handle felt just like I suspected...cheap like I could just twist it right off the van...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The seat felt like I was sitting on a tower with the windshield against my face.","target":"Genuine

something that should be standard on a more than basic model.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The controls were all handy but again, cheap looking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior was very drab and the seat covers covered up that mistake well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ride was very stiff and loud and the acceleration seemed sluggish.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did not feel safe at all in this van.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'd say the back seating was sufficient except for the very back seat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There did not seem to be much leg room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"What did I like?","target":"Genuine

a handy shelf system but it's made of plastic and I feel this will probably break after a while somehow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also like the length of the vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It would probably be easy to move from a sedan to this vehicle and wouldn't take long to get used to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've seen a lot of these Villager's out on the road and I've noticed they don't hold their shiney integrity once they're a year old or so.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They start to look, cheap, the paint dulls right up and the two tone models just exagerate this even more in my opinion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They show scuffs and scratches very easily, maybe it is the quality of paint they use?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'd say pass this vehicle up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It did not do well at all on crash tests and for what my neighbor paid ( $ 28,000 ) they could have gotten an a lot nicer minivan.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In my opinion, steer clear of this van.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You'll be dissatisfied in the long run.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And never pay more than $ 22,000 if you have to have one.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As the saying goes, you get what you pay for!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You know youre in trouble when, after driving a certain car for just three days, you find yourself desperately looking for something to like about that car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Gear shifter looks cool the reasoning begins.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But alas, it just is not mean to be  the Mercury Cougar is simply not a great car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The trouble with the Cougar is that it is a perfectly fine car when judged on its own merits  adequate power, distinct styling, plenty of options etc., but it falls short when one considers the vehicles that the Cougar is competing against  VW Turbo Beetle, VW GTI, Dodge Stratus Coupe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Frankly there is little reason to choose the Cougar when shopping for a sporty coupe in the $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 range.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cougars of past have been big, luxury cars, or high powered muscle cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This Cougar is neither.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is front-wheel drive and a V8 engine is nowhere to be found.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Without the badges, youd be hard pressed to figure out that this is a Cougar.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Not so with many other Ford products; Mustang, Thunderbird, F-150.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They all look like what they are.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even if you dont know the first thing about cars, a Mustang still looks like a Mustang.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Cougar XR (essentially an appearance package on the Sport ) offers many standard features: V6, 6-disc, in-dash CD changer, leather seating, traction control, split folding rear seat, air-conditioning etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The outside is jazzed up with a hood scoop, rear spoiler, 16 inch alloys, and fog lights.","target":"Genuine

door pillars and floor mats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Coming soon; a 35th anniversary edition  you guessed it, just another appearance package.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Cougar is not without its strong points, mainly, stand-out exterior styling and an interior to match.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Mercury Cougar is a good looking sporty coupe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its edgy styling gets noticed in a crowd.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Certainly styling is subjective, and the Cougar is proof  many feel the Cougar is nothing less than the very definition of ugly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Whatever your perspective, youd have to admit it is different looking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Note to Ford: The Cougar is not a half-bad looking car, loose the fake hood scoop FAST!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So many modern cars lure us with their rakish good looks on the outside, only to fall short once were inside the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not so with the Cougar, the edgy styling theme continues inside the Cougar with metallic looking surfaces and racy gauges.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Aftermarket style pedals, chrome accent door sills, sport seats with body color inserts, bucket rear seats, and an elegant but simple door panel design continue the style-fest inside.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other features worth mention inside Cougar XR include: split folding rear seat, rear seat cup holder, 6-disc in-dash CD changer, power drivers seat with height adjustment, and high quality leather seating.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And that is where the praise ends  a simple summation of all the Cougars strong points could easily be stated as such; looks cool inside and out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the interior is great looking, it is essential useless for carrying more than two people.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rear seats are for kids only, and even the front seats can seem cramped times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A cup holder for the back seat is thoughtful feature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Storage space up front is limited, and what storage containers there are feel cheap and plasticky.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The glove box alone seems as if the hard plastic it is made of may break with just one overly assertive slam.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Switchgear feels durable, but lacks the ergonomic correctness of many Japanese cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the road the Cougar handles well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, at times, the Cougar can be downright fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The P215/50R16 tires provide more than adequate grip when carving up back roads, and traction control is a welcome addition on a budget priced car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On paper, the Cougar seems to have it all, but in the real world just ok  comes to mind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Road noise is unacceptably high on all but the smoothest streets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Certainly no one would expect a $ 20,000 sporty coupe to feel like a Lexus, but the harshness of the Cougars ride is enough to make an owner want to avoid long trips.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Compare this to a car like the VW GTI where road trips are a welcome excuse for some extended seat time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even the Dodge Stratus has more pleasant road manners on the open highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Engine noise is pronounced as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes, it is great that the Cougar is available with a V6, but that 170 hp V6 is noisy and unrefined, running through the gears would be so much more rewarding if the noise level was kept down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Power is adequate, but no more.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"An imprecise shift linkage saps some of the driving fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Further sapping any fun one might wish for with the Cougar is balky and jolting experience which results from driving the 5-speed with the A/C on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The compressor switching on and off so taxes the engine that a jolt, or slight buck results  not fun!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Again, a car like the Dodge Stratus boasts a more refined engine and transmission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even the 4-cylidner version of the Stratus is less abrasive than the V6 version of the Cougar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Cougar is available with a 4-cylinder engine as well, but given the barely adequate performance of the V6, one cant help but feel skeptical about viability of the 4-cylinder version in everyday driving situations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A bright spot in the Cougars power train is fuel economy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Cougars 2.5L DOHC V6 has an estimated 30 mpg highway and 21 city  not bad for a little V6.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When all is said and done, the Mercury Cougar is a car with a few bright spots, but is generally quite lack-luster overall.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Cougar is an attractive looking sporty coupe, with many features at a reasonable price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The main drawbacks are: lack of refinement in the engine and transmission, a noisy cabin, and a rather small interior.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While no one can argue with the fun of a V6 hooked up to a 5-speed manual, there are plenty of other cars that offer twice the fun, and twice the refinement at about the same price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If one is shopping for a new car and the Cougar is the first car they drive, it will most likely impress.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, as soon as that same shopper drives a VW GTI, the Cougar will be but a distant memory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fitting, because the Cougar will soon be a distant memory for us all  Mercury will no longer make the current Cougar after the 2002 model year.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And frankly, it s easy to see why.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Two weeks ago, I spent several days behind the wheel of a 2002 Ford Taurus SE (you can see a review based on my week in a Taurus at

driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Car","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Enterprise rented me a 2002 Sable GS model, a four-door, with Lincoln-Mercury's stock V6 Vulcan engine and four-speed automatic overdrive transmission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The vehicle came equipped with dual airbags, power doors/windows/mirrors, cloth seats, AM/FM/Cassette, tilt wheel, cruise control, intermittent wipers, and AC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This model (unlike last week's Taurus ) also included remote keyless entry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Styling Notes","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This particular Sable was supplied in a metallic champagne color with a three-color interior package in kahki and gold, with a deep olive shade for the dashboard and steering wheel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The trunk, however, is carpeted in the same gray as the Taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Much of the difference ( what little there is ) between a Taurus and a Sable is in the styling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Given that Ford positions Lincoln-Mercury as their luxury line, the carmaker feels compelled to give the Sable a more luxurious look and feel than the proletarian Taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since frame and body components of the two vehicles are identical, any additional\"luxury\" must be imparted by changes in pieces and parts that are inserted, attached, or otherwise appended to the core of the automobile.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That, for the most part, means additional chrome: the Sable's grille has a chrome surround ( reminiscent of the Jaguar grille ) and the body trim molding boasts a chrome insert instead of the plain color-matched molding on the Taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Head - and tail-lights are subtly different; the Sable's lighting modules have a more traditional appearance lacking the elongate teardrop motif of the Taurus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The most striking body difference is in the trunkline.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Sable's trunk bears the slightest suggestion of a bulge at the rear, with the addition of a chrome emblem on the rear-facing surface to suggest the classic Lincoln Continental.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Interior styling for the Sable has likewise been dialed up a notch, with the addition of a snazzy two-tone dashboard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A luxury note is added by the faux walnut surround on the central panel, viewing which makes me wonder: is there but one supplier for fake burled walnut in the world, or does everybody make that same color and pattern of ugly plastic?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The instrument cluster remains unchanged, as does the central panel containing the climate control and entertainment centers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The radio controls feature the same tired black rocker switches used in the Taurus; the climate control is the stock three-knob system used by Ford for decades ( an automatic temperature-control system is optional ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Driver-Car

a genuine attempt to produce innovative designs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The biggest issue may be resolved by going for the five speed manual, but the automatic model I drove was

expect this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But did you budget the high fuel cost as well?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A Lincoln Navigator weights between 5,424 to 5,774 pounds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because of this, it has a V8 engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Which means it gets 12.5 miles per gallon or less average.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Meaning that a Navigator driver is paying on average 3 to 4 times more for gas that a car driver.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This will add somewhere between $ 100 to $ 250 a month to your car payment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Okay, gas is cheap now..but for how long?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When it goes back up, typically the resale value on the Navigator and other large SUVs goes down considerably, no one wants something that is going to use that much gas when the cost is unsteady.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Thats a lot of money to lose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then theres insurance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because the Navigator is big and heavy, if the driver gets into an accident, it will cause a lot of property damage and injuries that your insurance company will have to pay for.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On top of that, there is a big risk that the drivers or drivers family of the smaller cars will sue you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Which means you and/or your insurance company could be out a lot of money.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They plan for this by charging a lot higher premium on SUVs than normal size cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This can vary with no-fault states.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You should get a quote from your insurance company first.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now, on average, the Navigator puts out over 3 times the carbon dioxide of a normal sized car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This really

have a custom oversized garageanother expense.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But, if you leave is outside, it s always dirty and that s a lot of SUV to wash or have washed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One more popular misconception about large SUVs is that they are safer for families.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the most part, they are not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Especially the Navigator, it s based of the Ford F-150 chassis which has terrible ratings because it is still a truck body with out properly

10,000 to $ 15,000, have a safer, more versatile vehicle and get better gas mileage.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Or maybe something that large is not needed at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Why would anyone want to buy this car?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The extra $ 6-7K buys you a car that has worse handling characteristics than an Accord.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And except for memory /heated seats, xenon headlamps and 4 pieces of plastic\"wood\" everything else is offered in the less expensive Accord.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, everything but the engine....","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is an ultra responsive engine.","target":"Genuine

the acceleration is strong and linear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It will beat out an Audi S4 Tiptronic or at the least hang with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However

although the engine is truly superb the body is terrible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a shame!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 260 HP powerhouse is not suited for this chassis and is a big mismatch.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Driving it in its present form makes the chassis beg for mercy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would rather drive the 200 HP Accord V6 than this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The immense amount of power mated with the front wheel drive creates lots of torque steer ( which Acura'claims' it has eliminated but that is just press hype ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The tires/wheels are also poorly selected for this kind of power.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It makes the vehicle very difficult to steer on rough pavement and at higher speeds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The VSA system does not work well as I tested this out several times at the racetrack and the car exhibited some about of skidding out.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And the car that I was driving, with exactly 3700 miles, was rattling like an old clunker.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many people will think that just because it has 260HP makes it a sports car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hell no!","target":"Genuine

reason.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All good things cost money: ) It has the best safety in its class, handles like its on rails and has drop dead gorgeous styling.","target":"Genuine

pole!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The S4 is truly exhillarating but it is currently selling above sticker ( obviously! )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bottom line (update ):","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If Acura were to offer a higher priced pure performance-oriented version of this model for driving enthusiasts - with AWD, 245/45R18 tires, more comfortable seats to compensate for the stiff suspension, improved braking, real wood trim, 6-speed manual, reduce length to 186-188\" while maintaining interior room and improve the sedate styling, this would attract a lot of attention and seriously compete with bonafide sports cars like the Audi S4.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After reading the positive reviews posted on epinion, I thought I would share my negative experience with consumers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seems the Ford focus is a hit or miss model; the cars built right run fine, but those that

almost half that time doesn't bode well for Ford reliabilty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fuel pump problems seem to be our burden, but other focus owners have different, but equally disappointing problems with their vehicles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Something common to all focuses though are brake problems.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Car rental companies with focuses on their lot are told to replace brake pads at 15,000-20,000 miles because pads fail like clockwork.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Car owners, unfortunately, are only given a warranty on brakes for 3 years or 12,000 miles, so replacement pads are an out-of-pocket expense.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A repeated problem continually found on focus complaint records are brakes that squeal and grind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The problem cannot be fixed, and Ford denies there are any design flaws.","target":"Genuine

drove a car, this would be it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I love Ford's New Edge design concept, which traces it's roots back directly to the Ford GT-90 concept car of the early nineties ( who says concept cars serve no purpose in the production world? ), and I think they did a particularly bang-up job with the Focus 3-door ( much better than the new-style Cougar ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The car looks like it's hauling a-- even when it's parked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I often find myself standing and staring at it after parking just because it looks so darned cool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The agressive, angular front end mates well with the curved, swooping roofline that tapers off in the rear, and the custom fog lights, rear spoiler, and 17-inch argent five-star rims that SVT installed put the icing on the cake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not that cheap sugar icing, either -- we're talking gourmet butter icing, baby!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And, although it is defined as a\" small car,\" it really isn't that small.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's taller than most of the cars I park next to, and the wheelbase is","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"103 inches.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let's talk about comfort now...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The smell of the leather interior is absolutely dreamy, and it is outdone only by the way the SVT seat wraps around you and makes you feel completely comfy while driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They fit [me ] so well, in fact, that when I'm driving, I actually cannot feel the seat.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Say what?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You read that right.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let me explain...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You know how, after you've been in a car for a while, you can tell what parts of the seat are pushing on you?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe your thighs are pressing against the side supports, or the lumbar support is jutting into your back a tad too much, or maybe even that darned seatbelt extension is about an inch too long, and it's poking your beer belly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No problems for me in the SVT!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Even after extended periods in the car, the seat feels completely natural.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is due, in part, to the nice adjustments Ford built into them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only can you adjust the lumbar support, back angle, and forward position, but you can also adjust the ride height of the seat.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Very nice for adjusting the headroom and seeing over the steering wheel, should you need a\"boost\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"BTW, I'm 6'1\", 200 lbs., just so you can gauge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Driving position is excellent and sporty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The steering wheel and gear shifter are exactly where they should be in relation to the driver.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All controls are within easy reach, and the leather-wrapped wheel and shift knob are a dream to grab.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The silver-faced guage cluster is awesome and easy to see.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At night, the faces glow green and the numbers are black.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The red SVT graphic on the panel glows purple under the gauge lights -- pretty cool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think the stereo controls could have been laid out a little more stylishly, but they aren't bad ( They're definitely better than the plastic toy Speak'n Spell-style buttons that GM loves to put in their vehicles! ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The stereo display is large and very easy to read.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh, by-the-way, it sounds great, too!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The subwoofer is very powerful, especially for an eight-incher.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is concealed in a nicely-finished ported box that sits on the driver-side wall in the cargo area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This takes up a little bit of your cargo room, of course, but hey -- did I buy an SVT to haul groceries and gear in huge quantities?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can deal with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The six-disc in-dash CD changer is a luxury -- no annoying cartridge to deal with; you just load them all in the slot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is also a radio/stereo control stalk that comes off the steering column on the lower left side for easy finger-tip sound control while driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In summation, when you close the door and seal yourself inside, the relationship of driver and car is T-I-G-H-T.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Road noise is a bit of an issue, due in large part, in my opinion, to the low profile ContiSport tires and large 17\" rims.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's a lot more solid material to transfer sound, and you can tell.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's not bothersome to me, but if it irks someone like you, then the application of some aftermarket spray undercoating would take care of a lot of the noise.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yes, the ride is rough on less-than-desireable roads, but I wouldn't have it any other way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You pay a price for a car that performs and handles as well as the SVT Focus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling is a dream, pure and simple.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't think it was possible, but the SVT handles as well and is as fun to drive as my hopped-up Alfa Romeo GTV6, and that is saying a lot!!!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you have ever driven an Alfa, you know what fun they are, and the SVT matches.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car goes exactly where you point it, and there is no perceivable torque steer, which is something that has always irked me about front-drivers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"How tight is it?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Last night I took a corner that was marked for 30 MPH at 65.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't recommend you try this at home.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Coming into the unexpected turn, I thought I was going to dig a trench, but instead, the SVT dipped its nose, dug in, and sprung right back out again, taking the turn and teaching the road a lesson while it was at it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Amazing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It behaved like it had a tough racing torsion bar suspension.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In, dip, and out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a front-driver especially ( 61 %/39 % weight distribution ), the handling is amazingly neutral.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is no pronounced over- or understeer, unless you really want it to be there.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Once again, the driver is in command.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine is amazing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ford took the already-nice Zetec I-4 found in the ZX3 and cooked up a variable intake valve timing system, which ups the HP from 130 to 170, and gives you 145 lb/ft of torque to work with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Couple this power with the gorgeous Getrag six-speed gear box, and you have speed-on-demand through the entire range of the engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Seriously.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are no dead spots in the power curve.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"From stop to redline, the motor will pull and go like a champ, with no perceivable lag anywhere, and it sounds great doing it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The gear ratios are right on target, too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Normally, with a modern manual transmission (esp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"a six-speed ) I expect fifth or sixth gear to be sort of an\"overdrive\" gear; not worth much for performance.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, sixth gear in the SVT is actually a useable gear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of them are very nicely and smoothly spaced.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition to the VIVT system, Ford also stuck in some other improvements, including forged steel connecting rods, aluminum pistons, and a dual-stage intake system, which dramatically improves torque and low-end performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The compression ratio is also higher, at 10.2:1, so you have to use premium fuel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are also some pretty cool mods after the engine, including the dual-mass flywheel and one-in two-out shaft design of the gearbox.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want to know how these work, you can find the info at http://www.svt.ford.com","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You have to be careful when shopping for an SVT Focus, because many dealers will charge an extra fee on top of the MSRP simply because it's an SVT, and therefore more collectible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, if you shop around, you can find dealers that won't gouge you.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I found mine at Covert Ford, in Austin, for sticker: $ 19,265.00,","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"which is exactly what Ford says they should charge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Northside Ford, in San Antonio, wanted 23K for the same car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In case you didn't know, not all Ford dealers sell SVT cars.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Only specially-authorized dealers get them, and they are only allotted a certain number per year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you find one for MSRP, don't expect to talk them down on the price, either.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"SVTs are also usually exempt from any special deals or rebates.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Having the SVT badge on your car guarantees a certain level of collectibility, and the dealers know it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Being an SVT owner has other perks as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You get a free one-year membership to the SVT Owners Assoc., and a free loaner car when yours is in for servicing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nice touch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you're into it, there are also TONS of aftermarket performance parts available for the Focus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not that it needs it...","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ford Focus Hatchback 2002.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Focus for the New Century.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At first glance looking at the front end of the Ford Focus Hatchback looks like a regular Ford vehicle but as you proceed to look at the rest of the Focus, you will notice it has a very particular look.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Focus Hatchback looks as if Ford designers started putting this car together by throwing away all the basic rules about designing a car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is well equipped and for those who wants to load it up Ford will offer you an excellent selection of options for your driving pleasure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior of the focus is very spacious and this is due to the raised roofline at the front.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also you should appreciate the extra wide doors which can make entering and exiting much easier.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the controls are well placed and can easily be seen and reached by the driver.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also I noticed that the controls most often used are placed in a manner that they are much easier to locate than the ones not used regularly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The exterior look of this car is certainly where it stand out from other compact cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only because the new bold design but it gives the impression of a tightly put together exterior panels.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It may take some time for consumers to get used to this design but lets face it I have seen other unusual designs that became hits with the public.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I guess only time will tell about the acceptance of this new style.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had the opportunity to rent the Focus during a recent visit to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington DC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I made my reservation, I asked the car rental company if they had any available and they did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first thing I noticed was how well the interior and exterior colors really complimented each other's, the car really looked good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"During the weekend I mostly did city driving and it almost made driving around in a strange city a pleasure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did drive for short while on the highway and again it felt that even if this is a compact car it still has enough power to feel safe for highway driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Breaking with this automobile was smooth and the vehicle came to a quick stop every time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Ford Focus I rented was equipped as follows.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Engine was a 4 Cylinder, 2.0 Liters DOHC Zetec engine with 130 Horsepower.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"IT had a 4-Speed automatic transmission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The brakes were disc for the front and drum in the rear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for the fuel economy it gets 25 MPH in the city and 33 on the highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The curb weight of the Focus hatchback is 2,551 Lbs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sitting capacity is 5 persons.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Ford Focus hatchback is an interesting and pleasant car to drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had the opportunity to drive it for two full days and even if it is considered a compact, I did not feel cooped in and uncomfortable at all in the Focus.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would certainly consider going on a long drive with it and I believe it to be an ideal car for a young family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Almost 40 years old now, the Mustang is still going strong.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"According to specs sells have reached over 150,000 units for 2002 alone; people continue to flood into showrooms to get the'best bang for their buck'.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mustang for 2002 comes in 4 models, the 2 base trim lines which feature a 190 horsepower 3.8 liter engine that is offered in either a convertible or coupe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other 2 trim lines are performance models, known as the GT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The GT features a SOHC, 4.6 liter unit, and is also offered in either a coupe or convertible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"NOTE: There is no Cobra offered this year, next year there will be a 390 horsepower, supercharged, Cobra Mustang.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Driving Impressions:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since 1999 the Mustang GT has underwent dramatic styling, performance changes, and minor interior and chassis modifications.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most people favor these changes made by Ford.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mustang GT no longer has a'just adequate' 215 horse power as it did in 1996-1997, nor does it have 225 horse power like it had in'98.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For the 2002 model year the Mustang GT now has an exciting 260 horsepower at 5,250 RPM, and 302 lb-ft of torque with its modified 4.6 liter SOHC modular V8. 260 horse power for a Muscle car/sports car may not sound'super powerful', especially since its rival, the Camaro Z28 has 60 more horses.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The 2002 GT does very well with the the 260 horses provided.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 5-speed allows the driver to get the most out of this engine, although it would be appreciated if a silky smooth 6-speed was added to the line-up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The considerable power increase in the mid-range after 1999 means the GT really moves!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Burnouts are almost inevitable when matched with the 5-speed manual, especially when in the hands of a driver with a heavy foot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The GT is very strong off the line, and continues to be so all the way to 100 MPH.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The top speed is reported to be near 150 MPH, but you won't see me driving one that fast, at least not on the street.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have only taken my friends 2002 Mustang GT Coupe ( my test machine ) out for a few runs by myself, and each time it's a blast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I do test drive quite a few cars, and out of all the cars under $ 30,000, the 2002 GT is one of the most involving to drive, and one of the fastest to boot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the freeway the Mustang is a little louder than needed, but this is all part of the fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The GT's dual exhaust offers a beefy note, letting other drivers know you are in a serious muscle car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mustang GT is very compliant on bumpy roads, especially for a performance natured car, and does quite well in slippery conditions, thanks to its genius traction control.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A stiff chassis and well-tuned suspension means the 2002 Mustang GT really takes to twisty roads with enthusiasm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A fairly wide-track, and large 17\" rims, with all season radials result in excellent stability and impressively high levels of grip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Braking is also good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My Test car came with 4-wheel discs with 4-wheel ABS, this is standard safety equipment on all 2002 Mustangs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Note: Expect to get around 26 MPG with conservative driving with the 5-speed manual.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also a 4-speed automatic transmission is optional.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"About the engine: In 1996, the Mustang GT ditched the 5.0 OHV unit, and got a new engine in the form of a 4.6 liter V8 modular unit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While rated at only 215 horse power in 1996 and 1997, and 225 in 1998, the 1999-2002 Mustang GT's offer basically the same 4.6 SOHC engine, only with 260 horse power and 302 lb-ft of torque.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This welcomed increase in power is mainly because of higher lift, longer duration cams, bigger valves, and a revised intake system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Mustang GT also got a revised suspension in 1999, namely a wider rear track, and greater suspension travel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 1999-2002 Mustang GT's also have received revised shock absorbers and anti roll bars to improve handling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"note: The base models equipped with the 3.8 liter engines do not get this treatment.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Interior Accommodation:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior of the 2002 Mustang GT is very well laid out, and very well equipped.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Test car came with power everything, a thick leather wrapped steering wheel, an optional 460 watt stereo system, with a 6 disc CD changer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( a 1,140 watt System is available if you want to blow your ear drums out.)","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some other amenities included a super cold AC, daytime running lamps, a tachometer, a theft deterrent system, and tinted glass.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ergonomics are near perfect in the 2002 GT, and so is the drivers position.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The GT offers excellent visibility, easy-to-use controls, and superior comfort for long journeys.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mustang GT's 2 front sport bucket seats were dressed in leather and boasted 6 way power.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The seats in the Front are very comfortable and supportive, but because of the lack of leg and head room in the rear, the experience is not quite as positive.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The front passenger and driver are given plenty of room however.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Exterior Innovation:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since the Mustangs Substantial makeover for 1999, this car looks aggressive and distinctive with a wider, more road hugging stance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There really is not much difference from the look of the base models, expect some minor cosmetic treatments, some include side hood scoops, and a GT badge on the side of the car, and a' Mustang GT' badge in-graved in the rear bumper.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The front Headlights are flush, and very slightly'cat eyed', triple taillights continue to be part of the Mustangs theme, but they now have sharper edges like the rest of the body.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Price, Warranty, and Reliability: The 2002 Mustang starts out at around $ 16K for the base modeled coupes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A GT model will run in-between $ 22,000-$ 28,000.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My test car has 8,000 miles on it, and my friend has never had to take it to the shop, but with only 8,000 miles it's kinda hard to comment on her car's reliability.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The GT has always been a fairly reliable car, even in its pushrod days, the GT has offered years of reliable performance, just look at all the older GT's we see on the road.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I suggest you ask around, I'm guessing you will hear good news from the owners of these cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ford does not offer the best warranty, Ford offers a 3 year 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty on the GT.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Final Notes:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It takes a certain type of person to appreciate the Mustang GT, if you are into high revving 4-cylinders this is definitely not your car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The 2002 GT offers excellent muscle and accommodation at an excellent price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you liked this review, you might also like to read my review on the Mustang's rival, the Camaro Z28","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"-Happy Car Shopping!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I feel, that since I have had my Mustang seventeen months and have put on just shy of 26,000 miles, I can make a fair assessment of this vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have a laser red 5-speed GT convertible with the premium package and a beige leather interior and beige top.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I will review the following aspects of the vehicle: interior and exterior styling, performance, handling and driver and passenger comfort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Along the way, I will touch on the aspects of the vehicle that I don't like and those that I really enjoy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Exterior Styling","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I really like the way the car looks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After parking it and walking away, I often have the urge to look over my shoulder to take another look at the vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sharp lines and coordinating ( in my opinion ) bright red and beige top really stand out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the fake hood and side scoops draw a lot of flack, they do add a certain amount of flair to the car, allowing it to stand out and look a little more muscular.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 17-inch Bullitt wheels with the three stripe Mustang logo in the center are classic and add a nice throwback to the styling of the 70's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One small weakness is the that wheel wells seem too large for the 17\" wheels and give, what has been described by a friend as, a 4x4 look to the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I couldn't agree more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"18\" wheels really fill the wells and make the car look even better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lines of the car provide the driver with a high hood and shoulder line but this is acceptable to make one feel more like they're sitting in the car, despite the flat bucket seats ( more on that later ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The dual, stainless exhaust tips accent the rear of the vehicle, my favorite aspect of the styling is the front fascia, headlights and grille with the chrome mustang.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A good compromise was made, I feel, between aggressive and sleek design options.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The wrap-around headlights and indicators provide a sleek, aerodynamic appeal while the fairly sharp-cornered bumper and raked grille add a slight harshness to the smoothness of the other details.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall the car looks great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only downfall I can see with the exterior design is the possibility that it may look a little dated in a few years, much like the mid to late 90's Mustangs do.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On a slightly similar note, one problem with the exterior of my vehicle is that the driver and passenger doors don't seem to line up flush with the rear quarter panels.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"While this doesn't detract from the overall styling, it's annoying none-the-less.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm really excited about the'05 Mustang styling and it may force me to buy another one a few years down the road.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Interior Styling","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This really is a love-hate relationship.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beige dash, carpet and leather go really well with the red exterior and beige top.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have had a number of people comment on how nice the interior of the car looks upon entering the vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And, for the most part I agree.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The light beige with dark brown accents provides a comfortable atmosphere in which to drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The symmetric gauge cluster is simple, clean and easy to read and at night, it lights up with pleasing green and red hues.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The center console, where the HVAC., radio and miscellaneous buttons for fog lights, traction control and rear defrost are located, also light up in the same green glow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The three HVAC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"knobs are simple looking but effective.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The wrap-around dash and door panels provide a decent cockpit-like feel to finish off the styling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another nice touch is the proliferation of the galloping mustang: on the steering wheel, stitched into the driver and passenger seats, in the floor mats and on the windshield.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A nice touch to impress upon the passengers that this is in fact a true American icon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The problem is, like the exterior styling, I fear the interior will also feel dated in a couple of years.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The\"dual arch\" dash with sloping center console that transitions to the shifter bezel and armrest seems cliched.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, while some of the materials feel good to the touch and provide a soft, almost spongy feel, others, like the door handle inserts, shifter bezel, A-pillar covers and center console panels feel like, and really are, cheap plastic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cruise control buttons also seem like an item that has been thrifted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A few months ago, the retainer tab that keeps the on and off button in place broke, causing the button to fall off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fit and finish is also a bit below par.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The A-pillar covers don't line up well with the dash, the center console panel doesn't sit flush with the shifter bezel and the door handle inserts bow out and leave a gap between the main door panel and the insert.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The last problem, with the door panel inserts, causes an annoying buzzing issue when the radio is turned up or there is a large bass hit from the speakers in the doors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And lastly, the seats for this version of the Mustang could use some attention.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They provide very little lateral support such that when cornering, one is inclined to slide around a fair amount.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Further, they don't look like true pony or sports car buckets but instead they are flat and unappealing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The leather seems a bit hard and the\"back seat\" ( in quotes because its best use is as a package shelf ) is done in vinyl and not leather.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The head rests on the front two seats are small and because of the seat back design appear almost worthless in preventing any sort of whiplash.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't understand the oversight here because the other versions of the Mustang: Bullitt, Mach 1 and Cobra have better leather and head rests.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm almost inclined to say that my friend's cloth GT seats are better than mine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even though I like leather better than cloth, it makes it hard to overlook these shortfalls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another such short fall was at about 10,000 miles some cracking in the driver's side seat back requiring a replacement of the seat cover started to appear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Additionally, I would very much like to replace my head rests with matching Bullitt or Mach 1 restraints but I'm not sure the same color is available.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Performance","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Performance: one of the main reasons for the purchase of this car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Does it get any better than a V8 linked to a 5 speed manual transmission?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While this is highly debatable, it probably doesn't get much better than the Mustang considering the cost of the vehicle and what it was designed to do.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My GT is outfitted with Ford's 4.6L 2V SOHC V8 from their modular line of eight cylinder engines and the Tremec T3650 5-speed manual transmission ( as I understand it, an original Getrag design, though I may be mistaken ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Horsepower is rated at 260 hp at 5250 RPM and there is 302 lb-ft of twist available at 4000 RPM.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the car pulls pretty well below 2500 RPMs, the real acceleration and power is definitely felt in the 3000-5000 RPM range.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The exhaust note adds the exclamation point to the power and acceleration making the car feel a bit faster than it probably is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, it is very easy to chirp the tires in first, second and third gears when accelerating hard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car possesses a willingness to go from a standstill and has no problems accelerating onto an interstate or overtaking a semi at highway cruising speeds.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There's an addictive quality to downshifting from fifth gear into forth or even third at these higher speeds, and watching the revs ramp up eagerly while the engine responds appropriately.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car feels just as capable cruising along at 70 to 85 mph as it does between 35 and 45 mph.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Surprisingly to me, it seems that the engine would not be out of its element to cruise along at 85 mph all day long, much like the machinery under the hood of a BMW.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This aspect of the engine, while pleasing, was quite surprising and unexpected.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I hope the durability and dependability will live up to this notion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another surprising and pleasing aspect to the performance of the engine was the fuel economy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most of my driving is conservative: shifting between 2000 and 2500 RPM, with the occasional high-speed shift.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With this driving, I have been able to obtain an overall fuel economy of just over 22 MPG using standard 87 octane unleaded.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On longer road trips, with expressway driving, I have been able to squeeze out 27.7 MPG!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This provides a range of about 400 miles; for a V8, I was impressed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The transmission does an adequate job sending the torque to the rear wheels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First gear seems short and fifth seems quite tall.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, the ratios seem appropriate and the transmission doesn't seem over tasked with the power and torque being sent through it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is not perfect though.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The throws, especially from forth to fifth, are quite long.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It feels good for going from first to second or from third to forth, but I feel a bit over extended in the last up shift.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The shifter also seems a bit notchy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I understand that these two issues can be solved with a Steeda or similar aftermarket brand shifter but I wonder if the notchyness and sometimes the difficulty of getting into a gear is the fault of the shifter or some other problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Perhaps I worry too much but I'm concerned about the longevity of the synchros.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On cold days ( less than 20F ) I've also experienced a strange whistling/whining noise at about 2000 RPM that I believe to be gear whine from the transmission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't heard it since the weather has started warming up but this is still a concern that I may have investigated.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And lastly, there's a fair amount of driveline lash that causes a clunk in some accelerating situations from low RPMs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, the performance of the Mustang GT can be defined as a smile inducing, great value.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling/Steering","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some of the best handling cars that I've driven include a 1997 BMW M3, a 1991 Jetta GLI with aftermarket Pirelli tires, a 2003 Mazda 6 and surprisingly a 2002 Focus ( all models, including the wagon and SVT handle quite well ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the Mustang isn't among that list of cars, it certainly is no slouch providing MacPherson struts in the front and a variable rate, Quadra shock rear suspension with Traction Lok rear axle and stabilizer bar.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Some of the most fun I've had in this vehicle has been entering the freeways from cloverleaf entrance ramps.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Accelerating around these slightly banked curves as the car holds its line tightly, exhibits the fact that the car has a nicely tuned suspension.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mustang has very little body roll when attacking corners and curves but unfortunately a large amount of dive and squat is apparent when braking ( slightly or hard ) and accelerating.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With all the torque going to the rear, the GT can be pushed into a fun over steer condition ( with traction control turned off ) and I've rarely encountered under steer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Two times come to mind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The most surprising and least expected, due to the good weather conditions and low speed, was most likely the result of some glazed blacktop on a two lane road.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other time involved some sand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Under steer does not seem to be much of a problem in this car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the whole though, steering is decent and boosted sufficiently at low speeds but not as much at higher speeds providing good road feedback.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The steering is tight and linear: a steering wheel input provides an expected vehicle turning output.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The wheel is appropriately sized and requires about two and a half turns to go stop to stop ( I'm estimating because I've never really counted ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The wheel has four spokes to provide a comfortable one-handed or two-handed grip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The tilting wheel puts it at the driver's preferred angle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately for me, the top of the wheel slightly obstructs the top of the gauges at my comfortable tilt angle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ride is a little rough over broken pavement, expansion joints, potholes and on dirt roads.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This can be attributed to the low profile 245/45ZR17 tires and somewhat aggressive suspension tuning.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a stretch of freeway on my commute that is so bad I sometimes fear the car will rattle apart.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sometimes, body flex is apparent in the convertible due to the suspension not absorbing all road abnormalities but this can be expected in any convertible.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Some axle hop can be brought about when accelerating into a turn from a stop over broken pavement.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a definite annoying aspect of the solid rear axle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I still have the stock tires on my car ( Goodyear Eagle ZRs ) they seem adequate and provide decent grip in dry and wet weather.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I probably have about 10,000 miles left on them and then it will be time to get new rubber.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't decided what tires I will go with but I probably will not get the OE.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would like a tire with a little better traction in wet and snowy conditions, if possible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Driver/Passenger Comfort and Miscellaneous Items","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When it comes to the quality of cars, I would be considered picky.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Squeaks and rattles drive me nuts and unfortunately, since my Mustang is a convertible, various squeaks and rattles accompany every outing in this car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I had to complain about only one thing in this vehicle, this would be it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The list is quite long: the vibrating door handle inserts, the center HVAC vents rattle, when the blower is on, there is a rattle coming from the passenger foot well, the two rear quarter windows squeak when they're rolled up, there's a squeaking/buzzing, on occasion, from the windshield/dashboard area at speeds around 70/75 mph, there's a rattle from the passenger side A-pillar, there is a rattle coming from the passenger side rear quarter glass area ( sounds like it's inside the body ), when the passenger window is rolled down all the way, the headliner buzzes and lastly when driving at about 40/45 mph with the top up, sometimes there is a buzzing noise that sounds like the vinyl from the top is loose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe I'm picky but none of these things should occur; though, most of these NVH issues probably would go without notice to an average customer ( which I don't consider myself to be ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"On the whole the car is fairly comfortable to drive, providing decent visibility and fairly comfortable seating with the lumbar support.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My back can get a bit sore after driving for greater than two hours which leads me to believe the seats could be better designed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Despite this small annoyance it really is a fun car for long distance driving ( longest nonstop drive I've had is about five hours ) and I hope to get it down to Florida on a future vacation for an extended drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some small annoyances but not problems I've noticed in the car include the following: Absence of a floor vent mix selection on the HVAC system ( a defrost floor option is available but I try to minimize my use of this to avoid the parasitic quality of the compressor on the engine during defrost use ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I wish there was a built-in compass and thermometer in the vehicle; I think it would be nice to have it incorporated with the digital odometer much like the new Explorer; further, two trip odometers would be nice, as opposed to the one offered; the glove compartment is a bit small.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So small in fact that the owner's manual will not fit; because of the space needed to store the top when it's down, the trunk is shallow and not very voluminous; and lastly, as eluded to earlier, the back seat is small and only good for small adults or children.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Summary","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Despite the small nit-picky complaints I had in the previous section, I am very pleased with this vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Considering the price, performance, handling, overall fun-to-drive quotient, styling and many nice aspects of the vehicle not yet mentioned including a in-dash 6-CD 400 watt sound system, convertible top, two power points, traction control, glass rear window with a very effective defroster, and decent front seat leg room, this is a great vehicle.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you're looking for a fun-to-drive, American icon with good power and acceleration, take a look at the Ford Mustang GT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And, with the looks of the 2005 concept, this vehicle line will continue its success well into the future.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Giddy-Up!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ford Mustang 2002 convertible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A few years ago Ford redesigned the Mustang and gave it back some its mid 1960 classic look, I never really understood Ford's decision to drop the so popular style of the 60's Mustang.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I always thought that if Chevrolet could keep the sleek and racing style of the Corvette than why Ford could not have done the same not only for the Mustang.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you notice Ford had also done the for the fantastic T-Bird that lost all its classic styling in the early 70s.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mustang convertible 2002 does have the look and body that tends to make cars become a classic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Who knows if it will ever be as popular as the original Mustang but it really does not matter because this automobile is a fun sport car to drive.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Looking at the interior of the Ford Mustang with the top is down is impressive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I like the beauty of the interior and how all the gages and controls seems to be so compact and easy to read and reach.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car I drove was equipped with leather trim Sport bucket seats, they are optional for the Mustang 2002 but they certainly make that interior look very special.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once behind the steering wheel, I did feel a bit cramped in, but after a few minutes I got use to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The armrest on the front console was at the right level and resting my arm on it brought my hands at the right place on the steering and felt good to hold it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The radio/CD player was an AM/FM stereo with a single in-dash CD player.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sound system is well located on the front console and is fairly easy to understand and operate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did not think that the sound was as good as it should be but I guess who cares when the top is down and you are going for a early evening summer drive down a scenic country road.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The exterior of this car is really something to look at, not only does it bring back the 60's style but it also gives the 2002 Mustang a look worthy of the new Millennium.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The hood and side panels have air scoops and the trunk has a rear spoiler that will give this vehicle a real sport car design.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was not too impressed with the 17 inches aluminum wheels; to me it seems that wires wheels would look so much better with this car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is something to consider to change in the after market for new Mustang owners.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Driving the Ford Mustang 2002 convertible was quite a pleasing experience and one I will remember for quite a long time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I would be a bit younger I would certainly consider buying one for myself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car handle very well on the highway, and you have the feeling that it hugged the road very well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for city driving this car is a dream, it is not to big to be a pain to drive around the city and at the same time it is big enough to be noticed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Ford Mustang convertible I drove was had a V8 4.6 litter SOHC 16 valves engine, developing 260 horsepower.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The transmission was a 4-speed electronic overdrive transmission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also was equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for the Mustangs of the mid-60's after sitting a while in this car you will start to feel less comfortable but that put aside this is a fun car to own and drive, I believe that the price is right and anyone who buys a 2002 Ford Mustang should have years of pleasure driving it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I opted for the Focus over a Subaru Legacy ( over $ 20K with safety features I wanted ) and the Toyota Matrix (tiny rear windshield, small cargo ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I went for ALL the bells and whistles as a consolation and am enjoying the sunroof, the leather, the nimbleness and the overall ride.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As I had to factory-order my 5-speed, there wasn't much negotiating on the price and I think I paid top-dollar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For this reason I was peeved when at 2400 miles my gas light when on which required a trip back to the dealer and a full day in the shop to replace fuel pump.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now at 12000 miles, she's been problem free since, but I have yet to see better than 30 mpg on the highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I bought this car the warranty was only for 3 years/36K miles and I have been weary of that having heard Ford horror stories.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I plan on keeping my bright highway-sign (\"grabber\" ) green ( very easy to pick out in a parking lot of silver sedans ) little car at least until it's paid for ( 2006 ), I'm just praying it stays together that long.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But that's just my nerves; the car has been great ever since the fuel pump thing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Resale value will not be in my favor thanks to my preference for a stick, and the legacy of the earlier Focii.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm glad I opted for all the extra airbags, because if an SUV ever runs me down, I'll surely need them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The leather has been a helpful feature as my toddler likes to challenge the durability of everything.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This past winter surely put the advancetrac steering system to the test and I must admit I felt very secure on the snowy, sometimes icy roads.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course I drove like a grandmother whilst all the bigger vehicles with fearless drivers at the helm sped by.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh, yeah, cargo is fantastic ( 3 more cubic feet than the Subaru! ) my only complaint is that they bothered to split the back of the back seat, but not the fold up bench, so I can't carry anything long with my kid in her car seat.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Funny thing is that it's depicted how I would like it in the owner's manual.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Go figure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Wonderful!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ive had my eyes on the ZX2 since it was introduced, but the last Escort we bought ( in 1999 ) was the 4-door SE Sport, which we still have  after 115K -- shows little obvious wear and were hoping that our new ZX2 will give us similar excellent service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our ZX2 has all the options except for leather  we like the smell of leather, but hate to actually sit on the stuff.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ZX2 is wonderful, but then Ill admit Im enamored with smaller cars, and I see no reason to pay big $ $ $ just to impress the parking valet, also our kids are grown, so the back seat is mostly just for storage on trips.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Before we bought the ZX2 we also looked at the Dodge Neon, the Honda Civic and the Ford Focus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Neon was unimpressive, but the Civic was quite nice  just not $ 3-4K nicer, that our local dealers were charging for equivalent options.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We like Fords, but when they replaced the solid little Escort with the Euro-esque Focus ( although both it and the ZX2 we bought, are actually assembled in Mexico ), I had to gulp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ive tried to like the Focus, and mechanically theyre on par or better than anything else in this price range -- but I guess my ancestors have been gone from Europe way too long for me to appreciate that wedge-of-cheese look.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I like my cars to look like, well, cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, the ZX2 was the best way to get back to the Escort chassis and drive-train weve grown to appreciate and trust.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a nice surprise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ZX2 reminds me of the little Audi I brought back from Germany in the 1980s  although the ZX2s fit and finish is much, much better than I remember from my Audi ( which I also liked very much ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its a speeding ticket waiting to happen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although there is never any doubt that youre in a 4-cylinder car, the ZX2 is noticeably faster than our Escort SE  twin cams, etc. Ive seen 0-60 times under 8 seconds in some articles, and although Ive never timed it, the performance is in the neighborhood of what I recall from my mid-sized 327 Camero  only the ZX2 gets a little over 35mpg on the road ( we usually get better than EPA said ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Weve had several Escorts over the years ( something over 400K miles worth ), and despite how the consumer publications always try to steer buyers much further upscale, I really think theyre missing the true meaning of value and sport.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Weve had our ZX2 on a couple long trips, and like weve said about our other Escorts ( after driving `em all over the United States, driving for days on end ), if two AARP Land  candidates are comfortable in them  then theyre comfortable ( we seem to drive 30K++ miles every year  but these cars make the going inexpensive ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our ZX2 is the most comfortable of the bunch, however.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Except for a timing-belt we pushed to 120Kmiles on a 1994 Escort ( dumb on my part ) and an oxygen sensor at 98K on our `98 Escort, weve had very few maintenance problems whatever with our Escorts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At first the ZX2 was a compromise that seemed to be forced on us because Ford no longer makes the 4-door models.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But now, my only fear is that Ford will soon discontinue the Escort ZX2 line altogether ( I've talked to the factory rep about this ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just hope they send the Focus to one of those Hollywood plastic surgeons in the meantime, it badly needs a facelift before Id be as happy with it as our ZX2.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Without a ZX2 on the horizon, that Civic just might be worth the extra $ 3K over the Focus  in the meantime were happily piling the miles on our ZX2.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Mitsubishi has finally decided to bring an up to date compact to American shores.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Lancer has been available in other parts of the world for a while so the mechanicals of the car and chassis are reliable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Additionally, a big plus ( for me at least ) is that Lancers are assembled in Japan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first thing you'll notice about the Lancer is that its exterior design stands out from the slightly\"jellybean\" Corolla, Civic, and Elantra bodystyles out there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mitsubishi gave the car crisp lines which establish a clean look.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The headlights and integrated turn signal assembly look more European than Asian in origin.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only area which looks a bit plain would be the tail light clusters, but remember we're talking about a sub $ 16k car, and most other compacts are no better in this regard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now on to more mechanical matters:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, the 4G94 2.0L Mitsubishi engine is the smoothest, quietest, 4 cylinder powerplant I have ever driven.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I test drove Focus, Elantra, Protege, and Civic high level trims.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mitsubishi engine is simply a jewel while running and absolutely puts the Ford Zetec and Hyundai engine to shame.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 5spd manual transmission shifts nicely and has a real 5th gear overdrive which drops the revs for quiet highway cruising.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In 5th gear at 70MPH, the Lancer is only turning approx 2750RPM.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The clutch has a high engagement point compared to other manual tranmission cars I test drove, but it's not a big issue.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"EPA fuel economy rating is 28/33 with the 5spd manual.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However on my first tank I got 33mpg in mixed city/hwy with the A/C on almost all the time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Considering the car now has only 272 miles on it, I'd say that's pretty encouraging.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Additionally, the Lancer's engine provides very decent off the line punch to get the car moving up to speed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You do NOT have to rev the engine up to near redline in order to achieve satisfying acceleration.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Lancer's chassis is an area that will probably disappoint pocket rocket enthusiasts expecting race car type cornering and go-kart like reflexes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, for the rest of us, a Lancer in stock form ( across all trim levels ) provides a quiet, comfortable, controlled ride across a variety of pavement surfaces.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling is not sloppy, but probably a bit behind the Protege.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Protege is much more controlled during quick cornering, but at the expense of a somewhat harsh and jittery ride - especially on bad pavement.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Lancer OZ is supposed to be a bit more sporty, but doesn't have anything mechanically to\"kick it up a notch\" in the handling department versus the LS or ES trims.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only chassis related complaint I have is that the power steering is overboosted at low speed and the suspension allows a bit more body roll that I would normally like.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My Lancer came with Goodyear Eagle LS tires, which are a pure passenger car tire with no performance inclination.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If there was a weakest link on my OZ as delivered, this would be it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Brakes are front ventilated disc / rear drum and provide sufficient stopping power for normal duties.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the other cars I've mentioned with the exception of the Protege ES use a disc/drum setup, but it would have been nice if Mitsubishi had installed four wheel disc brakes ( on the OZ at least ) for increased stopping power.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only quirk is that Mitsubishi only offers ABS on the Lancer LS trim level, it's not available on the ES or OZ.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"To sum it up, when you drive the car under normal use, it's amazingly smooth and refined.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You simply feel as if you have a larger car beneath as you go down the road.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Body rigidity is excellent which supports very low NVH ( noise, vibration, and harshness ) levels that the auto journalists are always checking on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Interior design-wise, Mitsubishi provides a very roomy interior within a small size car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I believe they probably stole a little space from the trunk to give to back seat passengers, but if I have three friends in the car, I think they'd appreciate it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The material( s ) quality is good overall for the price range of the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would rate front seat comfort as very good - I'm 6'3 and 245lbs and long legged.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The driver's seat goes far enough back that I can stretch out while driving and a dead pedal is provided for your left foot for even more comfort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is plenty of leg room for rear seat passengers, no matter how the front seats are adjusted.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The benefit of the OZ for me was that a slightly upscale black interior is used with nice looking black fabric cloth for the seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Otherwise you'd be stuck with the typical light grey or tan interiors available in Asian cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another nice perk for the OZ is that the gauge cluster is styled after Mitsubishi's Evolution rally car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Gauges are creme faced, round, easy to read, and glow a soft orange/red at night for easy visibility.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just traded my 2001 Toyota 4x4 4Runner in on my new Lancer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am going to grad school and wanted to get a much more economical car that was more suited to my needs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After a week with my new Lancer OZ, I've gotten all that and much more, including a vehicle which is fully paid off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you're in the market for a new compact, you'd be negligent if you didn't go to your Mitsubishi dealership to at least test drive a new Lancer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm sure that Honda and Toyota loyalists may decree that Mitsubishi doesn't have the goods to compete since they're the more established players in the arena.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, a quick test drive may enlighten you to the fact that Mitsubishi has done their homework here and at the very least now offer a product on par with their Japanese rivals.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Acura 3.2TL is an excellent value.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only option is a DVD-based navigation system that holds the entire US map on one DVD disc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The features that are optional on other cars in this segment are standard

wheels, front and side airbags.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did not include other small goodies like grid antenna and leather gear shift knob and steering wheel, etc.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Engine","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine is 3.2 liter V-6 with Hondas VTEC variable valve timing and lift technology that uses two-lobe camshafts and switches between lobes depending on the engine RPMs to increase torque and power.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This V-6 produces 225 hp and 216 lb-ft of torque.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a new TL Type-S model that gets 260 hp, has 17\" 5-spoke wheels and stiffer suspension.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine requires premium gas and the fuel economy is 19 mpg city / 29 mpg highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Transmission","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car is not available with manual transmission, but you can shift the standard 5-speed automatic manually if you wish.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, automatic transmission, even with manual shifting, is no substitute for manual gearbox  the torque converter eats  some power plus you still have less control.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you hit the rev limiter, it upshifts, even if you don't want it to.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Mash the pedal and it downshifts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What's the point of having manual control then?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However if you drive in heavy traffic a lot, the auto will be quite useful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Styling","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some people might like it, but I would prefer something more distinctive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the exterior was improved recently, the rear is still bland.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Interior is nice, however, except the steering wheel that looks too bulky and the wood that looks too fake.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The fit and finish are very good and materials look fine for the price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The instrumentation cluster is excellently lighted at night and the HID headlights provide enough illumination.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cabin space is aplenty and ride comfort and visibility are great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car employs a floor-mounted parking brake, which I dont like.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its A Front Drive Thing","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The TL is a front-driver, which makes it better suited for slippery conditions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The torque steer is

fact, BMW and Audi manage to go faster with less power.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It might be due to the gearing and weight.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I would nt call TL slow  it is faster than a lot of cars in its price range.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Safety And Pricing","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although, a lot of

will see that TL was rated worse than it s German competition  Audi A4, BMW 3 Series and Benz C-class.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, they are substantially more expensive in their higher trims ( A4 3.0, 330 and C320 ) with the same equipment as TL.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lower trim levels ( A4 1.8T, 325 and C240 ) have less power, substantially less equipment","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Lexus IS300 is probably TLs closest competitor, yet IS300 is better suited for younger people who want a sporty car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"IS300 is a rear-wheel drive and I think it lookos better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The TL is a car for those who want good value, reliability and comfort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Bottom Line","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, the TL is a good value with lots of standard equipment and smooth engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But styling and the crash protection could be better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bought the new Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally model in February 2002.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My car is silver and since it's the OZ model, it has all the upgrades: rear spoiler, racing console, metal rims, upgraded interior, cd player with 4 speakers, and leather wrapped steering wheel and gear shift.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All that for $ 18,000.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And since I accepted the 3-year financing plan, I have 0 % interest.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So every payment I make goes straight to principal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You just can't beat a deal like that!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My car before that was a 2002 Nissan Sentra that I drove until it died.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was my first brand new car ever, and I couldn't be more pleased.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I started shopping for a new car, I also considered another Nissan Sentra or an Altima, a Mitsubishi Galant, or a Honda Civic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't like the plainness of the Sentra, the Altima seemed too big and\"old\", the Galant was too expensive for my budget, and the Civic just didn't offer the extras that the Lancer did at the same price.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I also liked the Lancer because it was the right size for a 5'4\" female.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't feel like I was driving a tank.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The thing I like most about the Mitsubishi cars is that you don't have to pay for each option separately.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each model and trim comes with it's own set of options, so you don't end up with sticker shock by the time you pick out what you want.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Lancer is new to the U.S. and it's reliability is still uncertain, but all the other Mitsubishi cars have proven to be reliable and I have faith in Mitsubishi's name.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car drives very smoothly and has a fair amount of pick-up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It can handle speeds up to 90mph without any jiggles or rattles ( and probably more but I haven't gone that fast ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The gas mileage is 28-32 miles per gallon ( wonderful!

the shade of an overgrown fencerow I catch glimpses of the winy tones of a stand of claret cups; simple fuchsia heads like wineglasses waving on slender stems; and over yonder a prickly phalanx of California poppies has invaded from a nearby pasture, long, fuzzy dark green stems crowned by delicate white petals around a lotus-like core.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On hillside and meadow alike, the Indian paintbrush nod wisely, shafts of color ranging from startling orange to fire-engine red waving contentedly in the humid breeze.","target":"Genuine

Xterra?\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is this the Ultimate Boy Toy?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Immediately on seeing your first Xterra you know that every inch of the vehicle breathes essence of (young ) male, from the buffed, muscular body to the simple lines of the manly interior.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The standard roof rack might as well be a backwards-billed baseball cap; that strange flat spot on the rear hatch is a precise analog for the perfect circle imprinted on ten million teenage boys' wallets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's no question at all that Nissan aimed this vehicle, with laser targeting, at a youthful male market.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Unlike Honda and Toyota (among others ) whose smallest SUVs ride on a car platform, Nissan has built the Xterra around the frame of its Frontier pickup.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's a meaty, beaty, big and bouncy bruiser of an SUV, positioned squarely to take over the Jeep Wrangler market from the sixteen-to-twenty-six age group.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The brutish good looks of the Xterra - tall and slender, with a two-step roofline and what looks like an over-engineered roof rack - should serve it well in that market.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pot's sweetened by a passel of wild colors - who among us has yet to see a canary yellow model on the streets?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- and a standard 100-watt stereo with CD, tinted

audience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the disappearance of station wagons and the waning popularity of minivans, the SUV has become the new family cruiser for Sunday afternoon rides in the country.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Families, however, tend to like their creature comforts: car-seat latches, two cupholders for every seat, DVD players that drop from the ceiling, six-way adjustable chairs, and -- above all - a cushiony ride.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Xterra is definitely not aimed at this crowd, neither its creature comforts nor its ride.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You say you want a small SUV with a smooth, quiet ride?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Have you tried the Toyota Highlander yet?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"' Cause the Xterra's not what you're looking for!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Driving Experience","target":"Genuine

plant.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If anybody cares, it was silver.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Again, if anybody cares, I got about 18MPG for mainly highway driving...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I engaged the shift-on-the-fly 4WD only for a trip down my driveway, though I probably could have used it a few times in downtown Houston's interminable road construction.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling is intended to be fun - and it is, as long as you're going fairly slowly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's a reason all Nissan's commercials show the Xterra grinding up the countryside instead of rockin' down the highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Xterra turns on a relative dime at low speed, which can be a blessing in true off-road situations ( or on Milam in downtown Houston ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At higher speeds, the steering has a tendency to wander on smooth roads, especially if the surface is a tad slick; and its high profile gives the vehicle just a hint of tippiness through high-speed turns.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ride... what can you say about the ride... truck-like?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"bouncy?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"not unlike a Kenmore washing machine with an unbalanced load?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Well, I said the Xterra's not intended for families, and if you're worried the kiddies'll get whiplash, this is one truck to avoid!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Be prepared to buckle up firmly, for this truck can put you through the wringer on rough pavement.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The little four-banger had great difficulty shoving around the Xterra's 4300-pound carcass, with lousy acceleration and a great deal of noise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Under acceleration, the engine howls like a lovesick hyena; even at a steady speed the poor baby sounds like a rhino with a bellyache - that's assuming you can hear it over the abundant road noise and the howl of the wind in the roof rack ( fairing or no, it's darned noisy ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The automatic transmission spent about as much time hunting for the proper gear as it did performing quietly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is definitely not the proper configuration for a truck this size and weight - purchasers are well advised to at least spring for the 170-horse V6 ( which is also rumored to be gutless ) if not the turbo version.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The driving position is high - heck, everything is high, including the cargo bed, which hits this 5'11\" guy right at Gluteus maximus level ( I'd hate to have to load anything heavy into an Xterra ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although you're up there with a good all-around view of the road, the 2002 model updates include a 2-inch bulge on the hood ( to make room for the optional turbocharged V6 ) that cut down on my front view; it's probably even worse for shorter drivers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My rental came equipped with step bars and lots of grab handles to help the less nimble clamber aboard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In a bit of inspired styling ( form over function, I'spect ), the rear door handles are mounted high on the door behind the window - let's see your average six-year-old operate those!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Critter Comforts and Car-Driver Interface","target":"Genuine

bizarre little three-LED indicator lights.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The triple-headed instrument panel ( derivative of the PT Cruiser if you ask me ) has good sight lines so you can notice that Nissan - being different again - uses an italic typeface on the gauges.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The parking brake is mounted beneath the dashboard on the left side - those of you who've had ACL surgery are forewarned, the left knee has to approach shoulder level to operate it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The brake release, though, is at the right side of the steering wheel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why? Don't ask me...","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Seating is mediocre at best; the padding a bit sparse for these old bones ( but then again, I'm about twice the target age ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Headroom is great all around, plus the cargo area is advertised as the largest in its class - and I believe it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cargo area comes with a tonneau cover for hiding the contents; it seemed pretty flimsy and rather awkward to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Part of the reason the rear sill is so high is a full-size spare mounted beneath the frame ( at least Nissan doesn't stick you with a rolling donut ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are numerous cubbyholes - several of probably useless size and placement - on the insides of the doors and around the console, plus a large locking glove compartment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A single power port graces the dashboard - mine didn't work, by the way - and there's a second inside a generous console compartment.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Two cupholders are molded into the console, their removable rubber boots make'em large enough for a 1-litre bottle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wonder, though, how many of the boots get lost?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also standard on all models are power windows and locks ( another irritant - no keyhole on the passenger door ), remote keyless entry, and cruise control.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Overall","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This baby is in no way intended to compete with luxury SUVs like the Lexus / BMW / Mercedes crowd; nor is it a competitor for the small-family dollar with the likes of the CRV / RAV4 / VUE.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's designed for and aimed at that subset of the market that actually gets off the pavement once in a while - as is abundantly clear from Nissan's advertising.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The truck frame gives the Xterra good towing capability, but the tradeoff is an uncomfortable ride at highway speeds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling is good at lower speeds, mediocre on the highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The stock 4-cylinder engine and automatic transmission are a waste of your time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Given the weight of the truck, it amazes me that Nissan would even offer a four, especially when competing head-to-head with the peppy 3.7L V6 in the Jeep Liberty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nissan as a company has a good reputation for reliability; in its third model year the Xterra also appears to be holding up well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I should note that my rental - which was delivered with 10K miles on the clock - had already had a couple of plastic parts break, though, and the dashboard power port was on the fritz.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many of the plastic parts seemed pretty cheesy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, Datsun / Nissan has put out durable, long-lasting trucks for decades.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Recommendations","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is in no way a family car, unless your family consists entirely of adolescent males.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The washing-machine ride and amenity-poor interior are a dead giveaway that SUV isn't intended for hauling around groceries; it's built to carry mountain bikes and snowboards and get them where they can be used.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can get into a base-level model Xterra on the cheap, though getting 4WD and enough power to get out of your own way requires significantly more outlay of cash.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the class of cars it represents, the stock 4WD is at best average.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That gutless four-cylinder engine and automatic transmission pairing are downers, particularly given the unimpressive gas mileage for the four.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Upgrading to the stock V6 is apparently marginally better, though reviewers are waxing rapturous over the potential of the V6 turbo.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ride is awful, but that's the hallmark of a truck-based SUV.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You buy these things'cause you want to get off the beaten path, not because you need something\" classy\" to drive to opening night at the Met.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's better suited to hauling - either in the cargo bay or on a trailer - than it is to elegance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Based on my driving experience and the potential of the V6, I rate the Xterra a provisional four stars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Be forewarned, though, that your driving experience can be diminished by that doggy four-cylinder engine, so the four-cylinder version only gets three.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fair enough?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A few years ago, my husband started a real estate development company with a partner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our new hobby has become driving around the countryside looking for undiscovered tracts of land off of which we can become rich.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yeah, we are still looking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sometimes that search takes us off the beaten path.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you are looking to design a subdivision, chances are there aren't any roads put down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is what prompted us to get the Xterra.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's an SUV without breaking the bank.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We are a Nissan family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In our 8 years of marriage, we've bought three, all brand new, and they've never given us a minute's worth of trouble.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Xterra is no exception.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We give it the standard oil change, and any general maintenance, and it gives us a good ride each time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another attribute I like about the Xterra is that it is pleasant looking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has got a very distinctive shape and has always caught my eye while we were out, even before we were owners.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The colors for this line of SUV's is so bright and sassy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've liked almost every one I've seen, but we chose the blue one, as it is my son's favorite color.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I've seen many women driving it, you ( or your man ) won't look like a sissy in this truck.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"What's under the hood?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just a V-6 engine, nothing spectacular.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This means little to me, but I will tell you this: If you are trying to pass someone on a 2-lane, allow plenty of room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are trying to beat someone at a red light, make sure you are next to a little old lady before trying it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But hey, did you buy this thing for speed?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No, and it isn't a strong point.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But it does handle nicely.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had a fair share of snow in North Carolina this year, and the Xterra got us through in every situation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And we tested it; my daughter was born New Year's Eve 3 months early, so she had to stay in the NICU nursery for 2 months before coming home, which was about 20 miles from our house.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We only missed one day of seeing her due to snow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now perhaps you can understand my loyalty to this SUV?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here's my Xterra's dirty little secret though: It eats gas.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have never driven another SUV ( I'm thinking Suburban, Navigator, Explorers ) so can't compare it to them, but it gobbles it quicker than my Maxima.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If we are on the highway, it may get close to 20 miles to the gallon, but I'd say normal driving is only going to get you 16-17 miles to the gallon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ouch!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you are inside the Xterra, the feeling of gliding on glass is not one you'll have.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I suppose this is all a matter of perspective, but being compared ( again ) to the Maxima, I have to say my bottom hurts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But hey, this is an SUV, folks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another little add on was the trailer hitch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apparently, this too is an extra that you must request.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We have yet to haul anything ( to my knowledge ) so I can't comment on it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I will say that the trailer hitch cover comes\"unhitched\" often and is a minor annoyance to the aforementioned anal-retentive husband.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Inside is what I like to call sufficient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I drive a Maxima with a lot of frills, so I do feel like I'm roughing it a little when I drive the Xterra.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The seats are canvas, and can be removed and hosed down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not that my anal-retentive husband would allow his truck to get that dirty, but nice to know it can be done.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One nice extra is the CD player in the front.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is one that you feed from the front, not a changer, but that's not necessarily a drawback to me.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I will freely admit that the CD changer in the trunk is more convenient, but you certainly get more selection ( providing you bring your CD collection ) with the front loading CD player.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The radio has a memory for up to 18 stations, more than we can actually get around here!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The speakers are sufficiently loud and clear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Do you smoke?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not in my car!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We don't have an ashtray!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You must pay extra for it to be a\" smoking\" vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, in the place where lighters usually are is just an empty cap over the AC outlet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You may use these to plug your cell phone in, or to plug up your portable DVD for the kids in the back-seat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Speaking of kids in the back-seat, this little truck actually has lots of leg room...for kids.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While it doesn't have as much as my Maxima, the kids ( OK, Ty as Mary Ashley is only 5 months old ) like taking the Xterra because they are seated up so high that they can see out so much better.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The seats are individual, though bench seats, which come with a third seatbelt in the middle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You may also push down one of the seats, or both, to allow yourself more trunk room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This trunk is where your extra storage comes into play.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You are not as confined by an enclosed trunk, so can find more space to stuff your stuff.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, there is a luggage rack on top, which we will use for the first time this summer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And speaking of room, this little dilly isn't as big as it looks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, we take this truck on our 11-hour trek to Florida each year, and I get to squirming pretty quick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had a back surgery a few years ago and it is hard for me to sit straight up, but that's just what these seats do.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can manually lean your seat back, but I've never found that comfort spot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm either up too straight or laying too flat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My other complaint is with the seatbelt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For some reason, this one locks against your chest if you move too much ( and for me too much is leaning up to change the radio station ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also creeps up along my neck, which my Maxima doesn't do, so I know it is not just me!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As confined as I feel in this car, it is obviously made for tall people.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had to really learn how to get into this darn thing gracefully, and I'm almost 5'9\" tall.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can hardly complain though, since this very feature allows us to actually see over some cars in front of us, and besides, the truck comes with a tubular rail on the side to help you up, anyway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's an SUV, people!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are looking for a manly vehicle, you just can't go wrong with a Nissan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've never been disappointed with any of their products, and the Xterra is no exception.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The folks at Nissan must really be in the business of shooting themselves in the foot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why do I say that?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Surely not because they are starting to manufacture cars that are worth buying: Nissan vehicles across the board have received more power, feature content, and even attitude.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"No, where they seem to make things difficult is by making cars that are so good, you'd think twice before buying another more expensive Nissan model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Take the Xterra, for instance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"True, it's a different SUV compared to the Pathfinder, but until its introduction, the Pathfinder was the only SUV option buyers had.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wouldn't be surprised if the Xterra had siphoned off a few Pathfinder sales.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Enter the new Altima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Up until now, Nissan had remodeled the Altima into oblivion, making it a ho-hum choice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Definitely worlds beneath the new Maxima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now, though, things are different.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'll tell you right off the bat: I really liked the Altima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So much so I'd be hard-pressed to shell out the extra dough for a Maxima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My schedule has been really hectic, but I still made it a point to go drive a manual V6.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here are my impressions...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"EXTERIOR: 8","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let's just say this car's new look is a head and shoulders improvement over the previous iteration.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Big, too... the wheelbase is 7.1 inches longer, its overall length bumped up by 5.7 inches.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The body is 1.3 inches wider with wider tracks front and rear for better stability.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Height was increased by 2 inches for more cabin space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the inside, the cabin is 9.8 cubic feet larger than the last generation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The body has been tweaked to have over 70 % improvement in torsional rigidity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plenty of sound insulation has been added to this vehicle, too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The overall appearance of the new Altima strikes the observer in a completely different way than the old one did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Me too\" quasi-luxury styling could be seen in the old model, whereas this model looks like it could actually make good on such a promise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This impression hit me hardest when I saw one parked next to a VW Passat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only is the new Altima about as large as the Passat, but it looks just as upscale if you look at it from the right angle.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"IT looks well put-together and solid all around.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And I'm particularly fond of the clear tail lights that just seem to make sense on this body.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, with all these compliments why not a 9 or 10 rating?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This part is harder, less tangible, and all a matter of personal preference.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From some angles, the Altima seems a little porky-looking rather than muscular... the bubble-butt in the rear comes to mind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the car is much more of a looker than the old model, it didn't really speak to me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"See? It's hard to explain, so I leave this rating up to you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"INTERIOR: 9","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've already made references to interior space, and when you sit in the car, you'll see what I mean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rear seat is cavernous with the front seat moved forward for a short-statured driver, and head/shoulder/hip room is generous front and rear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The trunk is large, too, with around 15.6 cubic feet inside.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let's start off with the most important stuff...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I loved the eight-speaker Bose audio system!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Large well-placed controls made it easy to use, and the in-dash six-CD changer was a real nice touch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The steering wheel controls were a nice perk, though I've read they are not illuminated at night, which is just silly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After a while though, I had learned how to operate them without looking down.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Overall sound is awesome, with crisp highs and punchy lows sandwiching perfectly balanced mid-ranges.","target":"Genuine

praised in the VW Jetta.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That says a lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for interior quality, a few cost-cutting cues can be noted, such as the less-than-substantial feel to the switchgear, and wimpy cupholders.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The leather seats are nice, but won't bring thoughts of Lexus to mind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other than that, I'd say Nissan did a great job at making the interior cabin very hospitable to both the driver and passenger.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Having sat in the Acura CL's heavenly seats, I have begun to notice that not many cars offer enough side-bolstering.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Altima could use some more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The gauge cluster is easy to read, and looks like it belongs on a more expensive car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the

would have liked to see a dual-zone, seen in the Pontiac Grand Prix, for instance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are plenty of nooks and crannies to store your stuff in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even the cup holders double as a storage space if you don't need them for... cup holding.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The 60/40 split-folding rear seat increases cargo carrying capacity, but you neeed to go around the back to do it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hinges on the trunk are of the luggage smushing variety, as opposed to the hydraulic hinges found on the VW Jetta and Honda Accord.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"ENGINE: 8","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Altima comes with two engine flavors: the base is a 2.5-liter DOHC 16-valve four-cylinder that churns out 175 hp and 181 lb-ft of torque.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The second, more enticing flavor is the on the 3.5SE model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It uses the same 3.5L V6 as the Maxima, though toned down a bit, producing 240 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I drove the latter of these two choices, accompanied by a manual transmission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine itself is a gem, revving very smoothly and producing a satisfying growl when pushed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Acceleration has been clocked at 6.3 seconds 0-60, and you can definitely feel this urgency off the line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Highway passing is easy, too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh, and did a mention that this car comes with a 20 gallon gas tank and has pretty decent gas mileage even when driven hard ( like I did )?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My complaint is with the friggin' manual shifter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Throws are longer than I like, and it's not easy to tell when you've actually engaged the desired gear.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is possibly the first car in which I would probably prefer an automatic transmission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's a shame, too, because I was really hoping to give this engine a higher rating.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"RIDE: 9","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With a multi-link suspension taken from the Infiniti Q45, this car rides very comfortably.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Outside sounds are well-muted, and road irregularities are well-dampened.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SE provides just enough feedback to feel sporty, too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I really don't have many complaints about this suspension.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It serves well in a family hauler and enthusiast setting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What more can you ask for than that?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"HANDLING: 7","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Altima impressed me here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Body roll is hardly evident, and braking is equally strong ( though I felt the brake pedal to be slightly spongy on the way up - probably a new car thing ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My usual\" cloverleaf test\" was handled with poise and confidence.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I even pushed the gas just a little more to challenge the car and was not disappointed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Overall, this car is a hoot to drive, yet has the balance of a car with a totally different purpose, like taking the kids to school.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the Altima performs admirably in the hard corners and is fun to drive, it has its drawbacks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, what's up with the steering?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of the\" sport\" that the car promises practically goes out the window.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Put simply, this steering feels like it belongs on a mini-van.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is completely non-communicative, and requires many corrections on the highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has no real weight to it, as if the assisted steering is assisting too much.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Understand what I mean here?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, it was pretty disappointing and is the only reason why I didn't give the handling over a seven.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"SAFETY:?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The model I drove was equipped with the\" ABS/Airbag Package\", which included ABS, dual front and side airbags, as well as front and rear head curtain airbags.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is all well and good, though I can't rate this car just yet until crash tests have been performed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'll change my rating as soon as the tests are done.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2000-2001 Altima scored an\" Acceptable\" rating by the IIHS in its offset tests, and received 4 out of 5 stars for driver and 5 out of 5 stars for passenger frontal crashes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Side impact ratings were lower at 3 out of 5 stars for both front and rear occupants by the NHTSA.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"RELIABILITY:?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While Nissan usually makes well-assembled cars, this is an introductory year for the Altima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine is fortunately not all-new since it was merely taken from the Maxima and modified, rather than drawn from the ground up.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Other than that, this is a new car, which means a few problems could come up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hey, it happens to everyone even the folks at Honda ( read: Honda Odyssey ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"VALUE: 9","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Altima represents an excellent bang-for-the-buck value.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No, let me rephrase that...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nissan has really taken the phrase\"affordable luxury\" to a whole new plane and should be commended for it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This car could seriously be sold for a price in the upper twenties, and perhaps an argument could be made to sell it for more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It essentially comes with all the stuff the Maxima does, but costs less... and here is where I make the joke ( sort of ) that Nissan may have shot themselves in the foot by making such a value-packed yet excellent vehicle ( I had to add\"yet excellent\" because sometimes\"value-packed\" is hardly complimentary ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 3.5SE package offers all your standard fare, most notably the 3.5L V6.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My car also had the leather trim, automatic climate control, Bose stereo system, heated seats/mirrors, and more.","target":"Genuine

equipped in the lower twenties.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( Sound like a commercial? )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The jury is still out on whether or not the Altima will have a good resale value, but has always been around average or slightly above so.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Regardless, this car stacks up well against its competitors, such as the Accord, Camry, and Jetta.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, I'd say it is the best value out of all of those listed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, bear in mind this is a brand-new car and you might want to hold off on budget-minded buying for now, as dealers won't be able to resist charging sticker or above sticker until demand goes down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"VERDICT: NISSAN MAKES GOOD ON ITS\" AFFORDABLE LUXURY\" PROMISE","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There aren't many cars that provide the same

from middle-of-the-pack to the front runners.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is it perfect?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well no, obviously.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There's a few flaws that Nissan should definitely look at... the steering and manual shifter come to mind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I still come back to my original question: where does this leave Maxima buyers?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the money, I'd actually buy this car over the Maxima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nissan hopes you can see enough of a difference between the two cars by increasing the horsepower rating on the Maxima, but I see right through their desperate move.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Outside the increased horsepower, better steering, and a few nicer quality touches, little separates the Maxima from the Altima... except for several thousand bucks, of course.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a penny-pincher like me, the Altima would get my vote.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"AVERAGE SCORE: 8.33 out of 10","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"VARA'S PERSONAL RATING: 8.5 out of 10","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"During its introduction in 1992 as a'93 model, Nissan boasted all sorts of things about the'new' Altima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some advertisements had the audacity to claim that the 1993 Altima looked like a Jaguar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't ask me what Jaguar looks like a Nissan Altima, but apparently the person who made that AD knew something I didn't or was in need of prescription glasses.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The 1993 Nissan Altima had many flaws, and so did the 2nd generation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Finally, I think Nissan really has what it takes, with the 3rd generation Altima to be one of America's top 3 best sellers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Driving Impressions:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Nissan Altima comes in 4 trim lines, the 2.5, the 2.5 S, the 2.5 SL, and the 3.5 SE.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately I only got to drive a 2.5 S, but this does not mean I was not impressed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The 2.5, 16 valve, DOHC 4-cylinder is loads more refined over its predecessor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hesitation is no longer an issue like it was in the 1st and 2nd generation models.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My test Car was a 2.5 S, which offered adequate-borderline strong engine performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With 175 horsepower, this comes close to the power that is associated with most V6 engines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even with the 4-speed optional automatic transmission ( a 5 speed is standard ) the car moved from the light with no fuss whatsoever, with a slight sporting growl from the single, dual tipped, Exhaust pipe.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Torque for this engine comes in at 181 lb-ft at a relatively low 4,000 RPM, so hill climbing and passing large trucks are accomplished with much less strain than most family cars that are powered by naturally aspirated powered 4-cylinder engines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cruising was also very refined, not as quiet as a V6 Accord, but the driver is in a totally hushed environment while cruising at 65 MPH; given a well built freeway.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Handling is a shade more refined over the 2nd generation models, but don't expect to see too much improvement, which is ok, because the Nissan Altima has always been a good car on the twistys.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My test car came with 4 wheel disc brakes with 4 wheel ABS, which assured excellent braking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This set-up of course was an option, so unless you are willing to pay the cash, you will not see the ABS. 4 wheel Discs although are standard equipment.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"NOTE: Expect to get around 28 MPG while doing conservative freeway driving with the automatic, and 29 with the 5-speed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, just to do a little MPG comparison, 28 mpg is less than what a 3.8 liter OHV V6'dinosaur engine' powered Chevy Impala receives.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Chevrolet Impala is heavier, has more horse power, has a bigger engine, less technology, yet gets better gas mileage, what gives??","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All 2002 Nissan Altima's ride on a 110\" wheelbase, this is around 7\" longer than its predecessor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The overall length of the car is also longer, measuring around 192\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The suspension consists of struts and coil springs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Interior Innovation:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior while not being as refined as many other cars on the market, and not having as much standard equipment, was quite surprising.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The dash is a little on the cheap-o material side, but did come with a tachometer and a optional trip computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I actually found the interior of the Hyundai Elantra GT, and Kia Sedona to be much more accommodating.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was an'optional' 8 speaker Bose Cd player that sounded excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This option came with a convenience package.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the entire package, which also included AC, cruise control, power everything, and remote keyless entry with leather trimmed seats came close to adding on 3 grand to the sticker price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Speaking of seats, they were both supportive and comfortable, the driver seat was 8 way power, and the rear seats were of the 60/40 split variety which folded down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would give you a comment of the ease of doing that, but I did not get the chance for conversion.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A center console is standard, a micro air filter, and many other amenities are standard, including dual airbags.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior is very spacious, and seems much larger than the 1st and 2nd generation Altima's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cabin offers plenty of room for 5 adults.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Exterior Innovation:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The exterior ( all new for 2002 ) is much more sleek/sporty over its predecessor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Nissan Altima is fitted with flush mounted headlamps with see-through effects, and are slightly'cat eyed' to give a modern appearance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The same theme is incorporated with the rear lights, only are more triangular.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Altima is very'cab forward,' not a new theme by any means, I believe the 1986 Ford Taurus was one of the first designs to be considered'cab forward.'","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"From the side of the Altima you will undoubtedly notice that the rear is higher than the front, and will notice the sloping roofline.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This car is the sexiest Altima yet!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Price, Warranty, and Reliability:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For 2002, a base Nissan Altima will run you around $ 15,000 with just standard equipment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With options however the price rises quite dramatically, the price on my test car was just over $ 20,000, and this was not even the 3.5 SE model.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Both the 2.5 liter 4 banger, and the V6 are both new for 2002 so it's way too early to comment on reliability, but if anything happens to your car at the manufactures fault, it's covered under a, 3 year 36,000 bumper to bumper warranty and a 5 year 60,000 mile powertrain warranty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let me start by saying that Im not a car person.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I view driving as a necessary evil, and a car is just the thing that I sit in while I am forced to drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When it s time for me to buy a car I figure out my price range, look in Consumer Reports to see which cars in that range get the best ratings for safety and reliability, and then pick the ones that look good to test drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ill never be a car person.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That being said let me tell you that I absolutely love my 2002 Nissan Altima!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ive owned the car for almost three months now, and Im still as excited about it as I was when I drove it off the dealers lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Im almost embarrassed to admit this, but there are times when Im in the garage that I have to stop what Im doing just so that I can take a moment to admire my car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have even stopped in parking lots and said to myself Wow!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thats a good looking car!  only to realize that it s mine!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If this car can get me excited, it s definitely worth writing about!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before I get into the details, please know that I dont know much about engines, suspension systems, and brakes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I cant explain the technical workings of the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luckily, you dont need me for that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Nissan Website http://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/ModelHomePage/0,9438,20700,00.html","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and your local dealer can give you plenty of technical information ( note that the website now details the 2003 Altima ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What I can share is my own unique experiences with the car  why I am so thrilled with my choice, and the few things that Nissan could do to make next years model even better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First - a bit of history.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I got my drivers license at 17, but did nt own a car until I moved to Florida at the tender age of 32.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My first car was a sporty Acura Integra.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At the time, my employer was paying for the car, so I leased.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I really liked the Integra, but when the lease was up, I chose not to buy it for several reasons, the most relevant being that I wanted a larger six cylinder car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Integra had only four cylinders, and sometimes while merging onto highways it gave me cause to pray!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Florida drivers are known to be rude and to drive fast, and quick pick-up is required for anyone doing a lot of highway driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I turned in the Integra and bought a Honda Accord V6.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is a great car and I had no problems with it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Meanwhile, my husband had been driving Denty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Denty was our 1989 Nissan Maxima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car was nt beautiful, but it never gave us a moment of engine trouble.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It got the name Denty  four years ago when someone sideswiped my husband.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The entire drivers side was smashed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Denty had some issues  after the accident  only three doors worked, only one window worked, the air conditioned sometimes got temperamental, the sun visor had been ripped out, but the engine was a finely tuned machine!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When a fender-bender finally killed  Denty at 180,000 miles, we were completely sold on Nissan as the maker of reliable cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We went to look at new Nissans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, I did nt like the look of the new Maxima, and the car was priced out of my desired range.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Altima, on the other hand, looked great!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I remember the first time I saw the new Altima.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I loved the silhouette of the car, and the shape of the tail lights.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car looked large and comfortable, yet sleek and sporty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The price range on the new Altima, however, was outrageous, with sticker prices starting under $ 17,000 and top of the line models selling in the low $ 30,000s.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Quite frankly, I was confused.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Altima offers 3 basic models:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2.5 S is the basic car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It boasts a 175 horse power engine, 4-cylinders, cloth seats, AM/FM/CD Audio system, air conditioning and keyless remote.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Consumers seeking to enhance this basic model can purchase the convenience package  which gives them 16 alloy wheels, 8-way power drivers seat adjustments, manual lumbar adjustment, leather-wrapped steering wheel, steering wheel mounted audio and trip controls, automatic on/off headlights, a security system, and some other minor convenience items.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SL model is also 4 cylinders, and comes standard with all of the items in the convenience package, as well as leather seats, the Homelink Universal Transceiver, and a Bose stereo with 6-CD Changer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Finally there is the 3.5 SE model which features a 3.5 liter V-6 engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Strangely, this top of the line  model does not come standard with many of the luxury and convenience items included in the SL.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"These and other features can be added on, but that is what drives the price on the 6-cylinder model into the Maxima price range.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think that Nissan designed the packages to be confusing and to force consumers to buy features that they dont really want.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its not a great system, and it will frustrate many buyers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I cant defend Nissans marketing strategy, and I will not try to provide the details for all of these packages.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Again, the website and sales brochure can spell out all of the options for you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Initially, the new car was going to be for my husband.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After driving Denty for years, he had his eye on a more luxurious car like the Maxima or Lexus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had problems with the price of those cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then, the salesman told us that the 4 cylinder Altima had more horse power than my?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Accord, and that pick up would not be an issue.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"All of a sudden we had the opportunity to purchase a great looking, less expensive car that that offered great gas mileage and that would save me gas money on my long commute to work","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I ended up buying a 4-cylinder SL model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its lovely - silver paint with black racing stripes, black leather seats, sun roof, leather-wrapped steering wheel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car looks sharp!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I love the Bose stereo with 6-CD changer!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I cant do things and drive at the same time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cant drink coffee, talk on the cell phone, or change CDs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With the 6-cd changer and steering wheel mounted radio controls, I have easy access to many music and radio choices, and the Bose system sounds great ( I even think that my singing has improved since I got the Bose, but youll have to take my word for that ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am very pleased with the way the car handles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have no problems accelerating onto the highway or stopping on short notice.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The car rides smoothly and comfortably.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its fast and peppy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have heard some complaints about the seat comfort, but I am satisfied.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am short and must raise the seat to its highest height to be comfortable, but the drivers side seat has 8 way electronic adjustments, and it is easy for me to find a comfortable driving position.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could go on and on about how much I love the car, but I think perhaps it would be more useful for me to focus on the few things that I think Nissan could have done better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"None of these would have changed my decision to buy the car, but there certainly is room for some small improvements.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"1 ) The center console / arm rest: The arm rest is set further back than in most cars which makes the front seats feel roomier.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a button that you can pop to push the arm-rest forward so that it can actually be used as an arm rest.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think the mechanism is a bit flimsy, and the design a little bit silly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe a taller person could actually use the arm rest, but I cant.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The console has no change holder.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its a minor thing, but I like a change holder in the console or a change cup  on the dash.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In its defense, the arm rest opens into two separate compartments that are useful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A shallow one on top and a deeper one underneath that is large enough to hold CDs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2 ) Power outlet covers: In the deeper section of the center console there is a power outlet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a second outlet ( there is one on the dash ), and it is a nice feature for someone who may want to charge a cell-phone but keep it hidden from view.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The power outlet on the dash is located low and to the right.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is in a good location  out of the drivers way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One thing that I dont like is that the outlet covers are not attached, and therefore, can be easily lost.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I think that Nissan should attach them so that when the outlet is in use, the covers will stay nearby.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"3 ) Sun visors: The Sun visors are poorly placed too close to the rear-view mirror so that the sun can shine in from the sides.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are visor extenders, but they are not useable since they would hit or block the rear-view mirror.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If Nissan moved the visors out, away from the center, the visors would be more effective in blocking the sun, and the extenders could be used when needed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"4 ) Location of the hazard light button: The hazard light switch is poorly placed low on the dashboard and towards the passengers side.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If were lucky, we dont need to use our hazards often  at least not in dangerous or emergency situations.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Here in Florida, however, we often get horrific rain storms that reduce visibility on the highway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everyone uses hazards in those storms to help other cars see them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I want the hazard light button to be in a spot that is easy to reach.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In a bad storm or emergency situation, it would be hard to locate the hazard light button without taking your eyes off of the road.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Id like to see Nissan move the switch higher up and closer to the drivers side.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"5 ) Cup Holders: The cup holder is in front of the center console.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is big and roomy and can accommodate two large cups or bottles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is, however, too deep for a normal sized coffee cup.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I like the overall design, but I think that Nissan needs to offer some sort of inset to raise smaller cups up and make the holders more user friendly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"6 ) Glasses Holder: The car comes with a built in glasses-holder above the rear-view mirror.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also had this in the Honda, and I really like this feature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The holder in the Altima is designed with a door that folds down to access the glasses.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When the door is down, it completely blocks the rearview mirror.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Granted, the door does not stay down for long, but this is a poor design.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The glasses holder in the Honda rolled open into itself, so that it never blocked the drivers view of the road or mirrors.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I hope that Nissan will adopt a similar design for future models.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"7 ) Side View Mirrors: The side view mirrors are slightly small and taper at the outside.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car does have fairly significant blind-spots, and I think that larger mirrors would help eliminate the need for the driver to bend and crane  before making lane changes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"8 ) ABS not standard: The car did not come standard with ABS brakes, and, here in Florida it was almost impossible to buy one off the lot with ABS.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In the end, I did not buy a car with ABS, and in Florida, this is probably fine.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If I lived somewhere where we had ice and snow, however, I would insist on an ABS braking system, and I would be irritated to have to pay extra for it as an upgrade.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now that Ive detailed the cars problems, Ill conclude by saying that I am 99.7 % satisfied with my car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Despite these few problems, the car has many small and delightful features.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rearview mirror has a built in dimmer which automatically adjusts so that Im not blinded by headlights from cars behind me.","target":"Genuine

60/40 configuration giving me even more trunk space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The gas tank cover is attached so that it cant be left behind.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The keyless remote not only locks and unlocks the car, but also can roll down the windows to help air out the car on those hot Florida summer days.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( Too bad it cant also raise the windows when those sudden Florida summer rain storms hit! )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The headlights have auto-off which I like, but I like even more that they have an auto setting that senses when there is not enough light and puts the headlights on and off automatically.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Im getting great gas mileage!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the highway I get over 31 mpg, and overall Im averaging over 28 mpg ( thats with a commute that is about a 50/50 mix of highway

performs wonderfully!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I drive two hours a day to and from work, and the car is a joy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Coming from me, that is a huge endorsement!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have driven just about every sports car that is out there - from a Porsche 911, BMW 540i, Jaguar S-Type and even the Subaru WRX.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is something about the driving experience of this Acura that is special.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While its true that it is not the best handling or fastest car on the planet... this is one of the very few cars that will give you performance with the reliability issues of the german cars or the spartan comfort of the WRX.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The exterior styling is not offensive but can look odd from some angles.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"From the side the TLS looks gorgeous, from the back it is quite boring and from the front it may be wierd looking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Someone mentioned a corolla...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I kind of see the resemblence of the high beam curve outs a little.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyways, I think it should be improved.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If we look at the RL, NSX and RSX we should see that the Acura has largely ignored the TL as far as styling goes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior is another picture.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I too absolutely love the interior dash.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ergonomics are top-rate.","target":"Genuine

just lovely and\"reverse illumuinate\" at night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The dash has external temperature readout, trip A, trip B, ODO in digital format and various other indicators for VSA ( Vehicle Stability Assist ), Cruise etc. etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is also the Sequential Sportshift gear readout which tells you which gear # the Sportshift is currently in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SportShift feature is without argument the best out there.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It surely beats anything offered by BMW, Porsche or Audi.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Acura has done a great job here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Engine response with the SportShift feels quite close to a manual...but of course it can never be as good as the real thing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Since this car is a front wheel drive it suffers from some handling problems like oversteer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Launch spin as someone mentioned is also a problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But then again, this car is not exactly a $ 100,000 Porsche 911.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"RWD is expensive to manufacture, at the TLs price I think they would have to remove a large chunk of standard equipment if they made it RWD.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The HIDs are standard on this vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"HIDs are currently very expensive and not even found standard on a high end Mercedes or BMW, yet Acura offers them standard.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They cost somewhere between $ 500-$ 700 itself!!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These lights illuminate the road almost like its daylight!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The light uses a Xenon gas chamber which is ignited with an electrical arc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is not just some blue paper over a regular halogen bulb.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The\"firing\" of this chamber requires an expensive device called a Ballast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beam also needs focusing which requires more electronic circuits.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you first turn these lights on you can see the light being focused...it is amazing!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the blush-white rays look cool too:-) Although the Acura version does not have\" Dynamic Auto Levelling\" which is an even more complicated headlight which is optional on Lexus, BMW, Mercedes etc.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The space inside the car is roomy

a Lexus GS430 or 540i... but for those that want to use their dollars wisely I would highly recommend the TLS.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"HAHA!","target":"Genuine

DONT! DONT!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You may want to look cool...BUT!!!... ITS YOUR MONEY!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its NOT going to be cool when you start shelling out the serious $ $ $ $ for all sorts of BMW service costs!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"First let me start by saying that I think the BMW is the most overrated pieces of garbage that exists in this universe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now I may pi$ $ some people off for saying this...but TOUGH!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have owned one for 3 years so I know what I'm talking about.. many of thost who speak so highly of the BMW have never even owned one!!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"HA! The BMW does not even come with leather standard...or power seats.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So why is it so COOL, because of some idiotic badge on the hood???","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That is a really stupid way of thinking!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sure the BMW handles great, but there are other cars that do that too for much less money, enough said!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now for the TLS.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is one heck of a car!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am totally in love with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everytime I get behind the wheel this car begs me to drive it to its potential.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The acceleration is fabulous.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The auto will do a pretty fine job, but if you want total control you can manually engage the sequential sportshift mode... this provides more fun than should be legally allowed in a automatic transmission vehicle!!!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SportShift SIMPLY BLOWS AWAY the BMW automanual CRAP.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine response is far better in the Acura.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Shifting also feels closer to a manual.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior is FAR FAR superior to any BMW or Audi I have seen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is very modern, the instrumentation is white faced and changes to black at night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lighting at night is incredible!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other interior materials are terrific.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The seats could be a little bit more supportive but overall they are great with the perforated leather.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I specially like the sporty headrests...they simply look gorgeous!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The storage spaces are plentiful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are two cup holders in the center console and two HUGE storage compartments under the armrests.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a coin area and plenty of storage in the door pockets also.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Acura Navigation system is the best out there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is very easy to use, accurate and has a plethora of options.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The graphics are great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now, the voice guidance is a little irritating because it is a shrill Japanese accent ( no offense to anyone:-) But this is inappropriate for the American market!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I am told that the voice data is on the DVD so the new DVD release will change that!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The BOSE system is pretty good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would prefer a little more power/bass but the sound is very clear, there is no distortion even at very high volume.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The body does ding a little too easily, but this happened on my 3 series also.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for fuel economy, I am getting 20-21 mpg in the city ( perpetual LA stop and go traffic ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is another amazing feat of Acura engineering...to achieve this in a high compression V6.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Obviously you will be using premium fuel on the Type-S.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"During the time I have owned this vehicle it has not given me a SINGLE problem.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fact, I need to now go and open the hood because I have not opened it for so long I forgot what the engine looks like:-) But of course I clearly remember what the BMW engine looks like because half the time something was malfunctioning inside!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Are there better choices out there for the segment...resounding NO!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For any price...Sure!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You could buy a GS430 which is also a FANTASTIC vehicle, but its $ 52K fully loaded, thats a whole $ 20 ( TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!

Japanese-made automobiles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just to rule out alternatives, I drove 15 cars in total.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are only interested in the TL, you can scroll down to see the TL review.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mercedes C320 ( a disappointment, terrible ride ) Volvo T6 ( very nice car, but still too skittish for a Swedish make )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Audi S4 ( awesome car, but questionable reliability )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Three Lexus models ( RX300-didn't want SUV, IS-300, cool car but no leather option and didn't want RWD, and the GS300, which is a really nice car, but glove compartment-mounted CD player ruled it out )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Toyota Camry, a disappointment, would like to see a sports version ( I'm glad to see they finally updated it, it was overdue )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"BMW 330xi was nice but way too cramped and questionable reliaiblity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mazda Millenia was also nice, but was missing key features and had no significant cost advantage","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"VW Passat, which I was very impressed with, but again questionable reliability.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maxima 20th anniversary edition, an awesome car with perhaps the best V6 engine ever made, with a long history, but it had no cost advantage over the Infiniti I30, which was the car that gave the TL a run for the money, but the TL won out with more powerful engine, higher resale and lower insurance costs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I took delivery in March, of one of the very first TL-S' available.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The TL-S is an incredibly FAST car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've seen 0-60 numbers in the 6.2-6.3 second range, and I have no trouble believing it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When I press the accelerator, the 260 horses are ready to run.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's great for evasive maneuvering, which I've had to use twice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once was literally ten minutes after I picked up the car, when an adjacent car literally crashed into the car in front of him, while gawking at my new TL.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I swear this is a true story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I almost had a heart attack.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luckily, none of the flying debris hit me.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As with most Japanese makes, the fit and finish were almost flawless on delivery.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is one small flaw in the paint, a bubble on the front fender, less than the size of a pinhead.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So far I've found no other flaws in the car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The minor cosmetic differences in the'02 go a long way in improving the looks of the car, which many consider bland.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These changes include a reshaped headlight cluster, integrated fog lights ( long overdue ), clear reverse light lenses and a larger, toothier grille.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I chose the silver exterior, with dark ebony interior.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The fake wood for this exterior color option is black only, which looks better in my opinion than the tan with brown wood, which is obviously fake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I know the black wood is also fake, but somehow I think it's better looking than the fake brown wood.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another advantage to the TL is the flat pricing structure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You get a lot of\"bang for the buck\" with the TL.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just compare it to any of the cars I mentioned above and you will find it's extremely well equipped.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Basically the only option for this car is the navigational system, which I could not justify paying $ 2000 for.","target":"Genuine

coded to the keyless entry fob you carry, which is a nice feature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car has excellent road manners and I've found it to be a smooth and comfortable ride, despite the sports-tuned suspension.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rear seats sit a little low, but there are rear air vents and an armrest with two cupholders for passenger comfort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The back seat has more legroom than you would anticipate and is actually quite comfortable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cabin is quiet and road noise is minimized through lots of soundproofing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 6-disc in dash CD player is very convenient and the 7-speaker Bose sound output is quite good, although I would like to be able to crank it a little louder.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But keep in mind that I came down from a 12-speaker 240-watt Harmon Kardon system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are plenty of handy storage bins, including in the door, behind each seat, and a double console cover, with a deep cover ( for kleenex and CDs ) and shallow cover ( for pens, etc. ) over a single storage compartment in the center console.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is an additional power outlet in the center console.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cup holders are excellent and hold a variety of sizes, from a Coke Can to the largest fast-food cups.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have not yet found a cup size that won't fit in one of the two cup holders.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"WARNING!!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you buy this car, DO NOT use the coin holder in front of the shifter for coins.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I know that is its intended purpose, but I had a coin that somehow slipped up behind the compartment, preventing it from closing, and was about to have to take the entire console out to retrieve.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Only after a couple of hours of cramming wire hangers and fingers up into the slot, was I able to get the loose coins out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a common problem, based on what I've read on the internet, and most dealers will not repair it without charging you labor, since it's not a failure.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So whatever you do, don't put any coins in the coin holder.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is also a nice cubby hole in front of the shifter for chapstick and keys, etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior is well laid out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The one problem I have with the interior is the foot emergency brake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would much rather have a hand emergency brake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If the foot brake released when the car was put into gear, it wouldn't be so bad, but you have to push it, and I've found there is a fine line between fully engaging the brake and pushing it too far, to where it releases without engaging.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This can be extremely frustrating until you get a feel for it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The key fobs have excellent range, and include a power release for the trunk deck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've had this car since March and will continue to update the review as warranted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"May 2001-I just took the car to the dealer for a recall of the power window control unit ( which I have not had any problems with ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They had it replaced in less than 30 minutes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"July 2001-I just rolled over 3,000 miles and changed the engine oil myself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The drain plug and oil filter are the easiest I've ever accessed on any car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are both directly over the drain bottle, so its very easy to drain the oil.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was done in less than 10 minutes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine layout seems logical and all the necessary reservoirs and tanks are clearly labeled.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"January 2002-I just rolled over 10,000 miles and have changed the oil 3 times and rotated the tires once.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've had no mechanical difficulties of any kind.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fact, I haven't had any problems of any kind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The car is great for road trips.","target":"Genuine

are a few things I want to point out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, he said the ride is horrible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is completely untrue.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have one, drive it every day, and if anything the ride is too soft.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fillings falling out?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Perhaps he is used to riding around in a 1976 Cadillac Sedan DeVille, floating across the pavement with no connection to the road?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Perhaps he needs a new dentist.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ride is hardly rough.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He also states that it doesn't really do as well as it should for a front driver.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Perhaps he should either drive one, or read what Road and Track said when they did an extensive review of the Type-S.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Namely that it does NOT feel like a front driver at all, despite the fact that it is.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Value.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He mentions that it's too bad that there isn't a $ 30K performance sport sedan, and refers to BMW, Maxima and I30.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First the BMW.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What BMW can you buy that costs $ 31K?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"None.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With an automatic, and a somewhat modest option list they easily soar past $ 35K.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How about a nice 330i?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"$ 40K for a car with 35 HP LESS than the Acura, and less torque.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ok, to save money, drop down from the BMW 3.0 to the smaller engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Have you driven one?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have ( 328is ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They have NO low-end torque and feel like an economy car compared to the Type-S.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Additionally have fun spending a thousand bucks + for snow tires and rims for the BMW.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sure the handling is superior to the Acura, but for $ 9K I think I'll take a couple of European vacations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bottom line, the value the Type-S has is very high, especially compared to the BMW.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ok, how about the Maxima?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Have you driven this car?!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have driven the 2004 SE and it is SOFT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Feels more like an Accord.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Great engine, lots of torque, and very quick, but clearly geared towards lots of highway miles and not back road driving.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Bottom line is this car is a HUGE value.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Absolutely amazing engine, and one of the best front driving cars I have ever driven.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't just take my word for it, read the magazines and hear what the\"professionals\" have to say.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"/Gene","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After a strong start back in the late 80s, Acura threatened to fade into obscurity with the appearance of Lexus and the resurgence of the German luxury brands.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Acuras decision to junk real model names in favor of two-letter designations did nt help.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But now theyve found a new formula, and it seems to be working for them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Like the successful 1999 redesign of the TL, with which it shared a Honda Accord-based chassis, the 2001 CL Type S came standard with everything except a navigation system ( even a Bose sound system with a six-disk in-dash CD changer! ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet it was also priced far less than the European competition at just over $ 30,000.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nothing significant has changed for 2002.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The most notable standard feature is a 3.2 liter six the produces 260 horsepower at a high but still accessible 6100 RPM.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is 35 more than the 225 of the standard CL and of the new 3.0 liter in the roughly $ 10,000 more expensive BMW 330Ci.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Only one transmission is available: a five speed automatic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Perhaps in an attempt to placate those who might wonder where the manual is, this automatic comes even in the regular CL with a sequential sportshift,  which supposedly offers the feel and control of a manual without the bother of a clutch.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Update: For 2003 a manual is finally available in the CL-S.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have driven this car, and posted a review of it under the listing for the 2003 CL-S here: http://www.epinions.com/content_72728153732","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So the CL Type S poses as a serious yet much less expensive challenger to the BMW 330Ci.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Does it really measure up?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To find out, I took one for a drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Styling","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The more serious mission of the second-generation CL is evident in its styling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first CL was attractive, even pretty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its tall, airy greenhouse ( window area ) and artfully tapered rear end gave it a unique appearance ( except from the front, which had a generic Honda look to it ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But the styling of the first CL did not exude substance and luxury.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its styling connoted playfulness, lightness, and perhaps agility.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet, despite some of the flavor of the late BMW 6-series, it didn't have the look of a serious luxury car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Acura has fixed this with the new car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though roughly the same sizethe largest dimensional change is a two inch increase in lengththe new car appears much larger.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is largely the result of shrinking the greenhouse and bulking up the body.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These looks are not entirely deceiving.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Though similar in size, the new car is about 500 lbs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"heavier.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These changes come with a cost: the new styling is not as distinctive.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"What designers refer to as the DLO ( for daylight opening, the side window outline ) is strikingly similar to the last Nissan 240SX, which failed to stand out against other coupes and failed in the marketplace.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Where the old DLO curved up quite a bit towards the rear, the new one curves subtly down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rear end of the car is no longer strongly tapered.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It now looks much like that of many other cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I personally lament these styling changes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I must admit they make grant the new CL a much more substantial, more serious, considerably more luxurious appearance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To hammer this message home the CL Type S rides on 17 wheels with a strong five-spoke design.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No multitude of frilly thin spokes or cross-mesh design here.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"On the inside the serious performance message is conveyed by perforated leather, metallic gray gauge faces, and, with the ebony interior, black wood. ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( The parchment interior comes with the brown wood of the standard CL. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The last, similar in appearance to that found in high performance Jags and Mercedes, covers large portions of the door panels and center console.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want still more of it, the dealer can add a piece around the instruments.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How can Acura afford such extravagance in a $ 30,000 automobile?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Easy: unlike that in the European brands this wood  is plastic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The tan interior come with more traditional-looking wood that is a bit orange for my tastes, but it seems to work for many people.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Especially those who dislike the trendier gray variety.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Accommodations","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I actually prefer the interior to that in the BMW in many ways.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because the cowl is low in the traditional Honda fashion and the

especially nice, with the steering wheel well below even a short drivers field of vision.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ive never warmed to the extremely high position of the wheel and instruments in BMWs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I like to see the instruments, but I mostly want to see OUT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though the side windows are much shorter than in the old CL, the beltline is not uncomfortably high, about on par with the BMW.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The front seats not only look impressive but are very comfortable and hold you in place very well due to their large bolsters.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They are slightly softer than the traditionally hard ( though still comfortable ) seats in the BMW.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My only complaint about the driving position is that the steering wheel feels a bit close.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since another reviewer felt it was too far away, it seems a telescoping wheel is in order.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though the Acura is over a foot longer and a few hundred pounds heavier than the BMW, and simply feels like a significantly larger car, it is similarly tight in the rear seat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though Im only 59, I barely fit in the rear seat behind a similarly sized driver.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My hair brushed the rear glass.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apparently the extra length and weight went towards the flowing exterior lines rather than the interior.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At least it is easy to get into the rear seats compared to other coupes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lift the handle on the side of either seat, and it glides forward.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Tilt the seat back, and it automatically returns to its previous position.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The CL does not pretend to seat five: the center of the rear seat is occupied by a storage console.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The major problem with the rear seat is that it does not fold downthere is only a pass-through behind the armrest.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The BMW does offer this feature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I personally would not want a car without it unless I planned never to use it to carry moderately large objects.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In both of the cars I own the rear seat folds down, and Ive used this feature many times to carry large objects such as book cases and cribs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the Road","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Type Ss throttle is tuned to make the car jump the moment you tip into the throttle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is both good and bad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It conveys the capabilities of the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But it also makes a smooth, subtle launch difficult.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Your passengers might think you're having trouble growing up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then again, this might be the image you are after.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Give it gas, and the engine immediately responds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unlike some high performance engine variants, that in the Type S is not just a high RPM wonder than offers few benefits over the standard CL engine in regular driving.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This engine does nt only make 35 more horsepower on the high end, 500 RPM further up the tach.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also has a higher, flatter torque curve through the mid-range, so it will feel stronger even in relaxed driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The torque peak is 16 lbs.-ft.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"higher, and is reached 1200 RPM sooner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This paradox is made possible by a sophisticated two-stage manifold not found in the standard CL.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As a further bonus, the Type S engine earned the same EPA numbers as the 225 horsepower one: 19/29.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Honda certainly has a way with engines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I should add that the engine also makes nice sounds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When pushed, it does not attempt to be silent.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Fortunately, the mellow growl at high RPM connotes refined power.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I personally prefer the slightly more throaty, more mechanical, sportier voice of the BMW 3 liter, but this engine sounds more luxurious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyone interested in this type of car will rev the engine from time to time just to hear it burble.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I really wish a manual transmission were available in this car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That ( and a hand-operating parking brake ) would solidify its claim to be a serious contender among performance coupes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It would also make the car more fun to drive, at least for me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The\" sportshift\" was easy to use: just slide the lever into a short slot to the left of\" D,\" and then push forward to upshift and pull backward to downshift.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This allows you to quickly and easily control which gear you are in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, at least for me, nothing can replace the responsiveness and\"at one with the car\" feeling you get from a good clutch and manual shifter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As I've already mentioned, this wish has now been granted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In my review of the 2003 I describe the happy results.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The key challenge faced by Hondas engineers was surely how to manage 260 horsepower through the front wheels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The key difference between this car and the BMW is that this car, due to its Accord roots, is front-wheel-drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Generally, channeling a great deal of power through the front wheels results in torque steer: the car pulls to one side during hard acceleration.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Remarkably for such a powerful front driver, torque steer is all but absent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Under hard acceleration the steering acquired an additional degree of stiffness ( partly an artifact of the way the variable assist is set up ), but it did not tug to one side or the other.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Many other car companies should study this car to figure out how this was done.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the whole, handling was also impressive for a front-driver, or a rear-driver for that matter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though weight distribution is far from even, understeer in hard turns is moderate ( though always present ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The nicely-tuned suspension, despite tires with only a 215 mm cross-section, sticks very well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I drove this car hard along a curvy road, yet felt well within the limits of the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The front-drive layout, not matter how well it is tuned, simply does not allow the kind of power-on oversteer that can readily be had in the BMW.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Otherwise this is a fine chassis.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not quite as tossable, but very stable and enjoyable enough for most drivers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The overall feeling is simply of a larger, more luxurious car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I felt more cosseted than connected.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For those who really like to make a car dance, and I am among these, Id still recommend finding the additional cash for the BMW.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But most people shopping these cars will find the Acuras chassis more than sufficient for how they typically drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I do not think most luxury coupe buyers will be troubled by the major fault I had with the car: its steering.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When the car is driven in a relaxed manner, the steering feels pretty good, with a desirable amount of heft ( if not exactly road feel ) once the car exceeds parking lot speeds.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But when the car is driven in a spirited manner, steering feel jumps all over the map, going heavy, then light, then suddenly heavy again, sometimes within the span of a few seconds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While this poses no safety issues, it detracts from the feel of the road desired from the steering of a drivers car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over most surfaces the CL Type-S rides quite well, especially considering the capabilities of its chassis.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only exception I noticed was some jitteriness over slightly imperfect surfaces.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ive noticed this characteristic in some other cars with low-profile tires.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I personally feel this is an unnecessary trade-off to make to get that final bit of steering response.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The BMW 3s Ive driven rode better, even with the Sport Package.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I suspect the standard CL would not have this problem.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have not driven the standard CL, so I can only guess at how it compares.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The extra power of the Type S sounds nice, 260 is a big number, but may not make such a large difference in actual driving.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The same goes for the stiffer suspension and larger wheels of the Type S. Are the engine, suspension, and interior trim differences of the Type S worth the extra $ 2,350?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I urge potential buyers to drive both CLs and make this judgement for themselves.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Last Words","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the end I was impressed by the CL Type S, but not in love with it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its a matter of personal preference.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want a luxurious, fully loaded coupe with a lot of power and above-average handling for about $ 30k, then this is probably your best choice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It certainly appeals to me more than the Toyota Solara, its closest competitor in terms of features and price, or even some more expensive coupes such as the Volvo C70.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a lot of coupe for the money, and it has a number of strengths.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But if you want the most enjoyable coupe to drive, with other factors being secondary, the BMW, even the less powerful 325Ci, remains a better choice due to its superior steering and handling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Especially if your definition of an enjoyable coupe includes a manual transmission and a tossable chassis.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 Acura 3.2CL is an all-around car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It comes with pretty much everything standard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's simply an extensive vehicle, that covers all aspects of driving, comfort, and convenience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Exterior","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One look at this car, and this section of the review speaks for itself!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2002 3.2CL undoubtedly offers a sharp, clean look to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The curves of this car truly makes one drool upon the sight of it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All in all, the car is very well modeled, especially with the dual exhaust in the back, allowing for a nice symmetry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The curvature of this car also facilitates the washing of the car, since curves are much easier to get around than corners.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Interior","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One could not ask for a more well-equipped interior than the one Acura provides you with.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The 3.2CL is nicely equipped with leather seats, which are quite comfortable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because the car is coupe, the driver and passenger's seats are designed to be much more comfortable, than say - a sedan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is definitely evidenced by this vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The driver and passenger's seats are both somewhat deep bucket seats that allow you to sit snugly in the seats without being overly comfortable.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Because I rarely have any reason to sit in the back seat of my own car, my account of the back may not be accurate.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, I have sat in the back, just not for a trip.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It seems the back could use a little more leg room, but this of course only depends on the seating of the driver and/or passenger.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Regardless, the seats in the back are rather comfortable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have also been told this by my passengers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course, if you do intend on having more than 1 passenger in your car at a time, you may want to consider the Acura TL - the CL, just with 4 doors, pretty much.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handling","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handling on the CL is pretty decent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It drives very smoothly, but a bit heavily.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If youre the type who speeds excessively around corners and enjoys being thrown into your door or armrest around these turns, you might consider another vehicle, such as the Lexus IS300, Subaru Impreza WRX, and other competing models.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course, you do sacrifice certain features when you choose another car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Regardless, the bucket seats hold you nicely around those curves and turns and the car accelerates very smoothly, if driven regularly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It does nt exactly have the fastest acceleration of its competing models, but it s pretty decent, provided the cars weight ( 3485 lbs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":" with Navigation; without  3470 lbs ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"All in all, the handling of this car is pretty good, unless youre one with a passion for speed and hard cornering.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Features","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 3.2CL is equipped with pretty much everything standard, which I feel is a big advantage of owning this car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything from the tape deck to leather seats is in this vehicle, which make it such an enjoyment driving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Navigation/GPS ( optional )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is exceptional on this vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is a touch-screen navigation system, which makes it much more convenient than some of the current navigation systems that are on the market.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many require the use of a small knob-like object to select your choice, which can make typing in long addresses a hassle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the CL navigation system, it s just point and shoot. ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, if you do prefer the joystick  style knob, that is available as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The navigation system is pretty concise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The female voice who assists you guides you well, and it also guides you to your preferences, which it should do anyway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition, you can select places by their name, and it can sort the places by distance, and so forth.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is an all-around comprehensive system that covers all aspects of navigation and GPS.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The navigation unit/screen also controls the A/C air flow of the car, whether or not you want A/C itself on, and the speed at which the fan is blown.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This feature is perhaps not extremely necessary, but it does add a nice touch to the high-techness  of this car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, if you are not using the navigation or A/C controls at the time, it can display the time for you set in a background of stars.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, if you are using the navigation, it will summon the time to the bottom right corner in a small box.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a con because there are no other points on the car in which it displays time, making the driver, who always races against time, have to make an extra effort to sometimes lean over to the right to check out the time.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This may be a safety hazard, for those seconds trying to find the time should be seconds spent surveying the road ahead.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Basically, navigation is all a personal choice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its just up to the buyer whether or not he is willing to shell out approximately $ 2000 for something he or she may never need, depending on amount of travel and sense of direction.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Maybe you could get it to show off, if you are the conceited type: ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Personally, I enjoy the fact that I have a screen and voice that can assist me in case I ever get lost and whatnot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Safety wise, the navigation system is nt much of a distraction, unless you are constantly looking at and inputting things into the screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just remember that though you may be tempted to often look down at the screen, the road is always the most important when driving, hence the female voice that assists you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Music","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Bose system in the car ( standard ) is pretty decent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It delivers a adequate bass, though I feel it could use a little more bass  perhaps another woofer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All in all, however, the sound quality is pretty good, and is suitable for most types of music.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A nice feature to its sound system is the 6 disc in-dash CD changer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a very nice and convenient feature for you dont have to go to the trunk to change the CDs, like in many other CD equipped vehicles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, Bose equips the CL with a pretty nice system, though a pinch of bass could always be added.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Additional Features","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"TCS  Traction Control System  This feature keeps your car straight  and not sliding and spinning after those fast sharp curves.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"TCS, or others like it, with other cars, should always be considered when purchasing any vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its a large safety factor nowadays, and it could save your life one day when youre supposed to be spinning 360s, but you simply fishtail a bit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Automatic Seats  This is a very nice feature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because this car is a coupe and it seats 4, it is pretty obvious that the front seats have to move forward in order for the rear passengers to get in the vehicle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is true in any coupe that seats more than the driver and passenger.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, most of the time, you have to lift up a lever near the bottom of the seat and manually push it forward.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not the case with the CL.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In the CL, you simply give the lever on the side of the seat a little push, and the seatback will fold down, and the seat will come forward automatically, giving the rear passengers entry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then, after the rear passengers are in, you simply push the seatback back, and the seat moves back to its original position.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This function is very nifty, efficient, and saves the energy of those who constantly have multiple passengers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sequential SportShift  Many current cars now carry this feature, though each has its own name.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its for the driver who has no interest in learning how to drive manual transmission, or the one who prefers automatic, but likes the feel of a manual.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I personally have never driven a manual, but people who have say the SportShift is nothing like driving real manual.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It seems like its just a cool little useless feature that can give the driver a bit of power when he or she downshifts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I personally have not really had the chance to take a ride in SportShift mode, but when I do, I will post an update!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Sure, the CL has SportShift, but it lacks the manual transmission, desired by those hardcore  drivers who really like to get the most from a car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Steering wheel buttons - To keep the driver focused on the road and not the buttons throughout the car, audio buttons that control volume and tracks ( CDs ) or stations ( radio ) are easily accessible by clicking the buttons mounted on the steering wheel that can change audio.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"On the right-hand side, there are buttons that control Cruise Control, which are also easy to get to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Automatic power window  Like many cars nowadays, this car has the Automatic window function, however only on the drivers window.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The passenger window is like any old power window though.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"HID ( High Intensity Discharge )/Xenon lights  This, I feel, is a very considerate of Acura to include standard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These lights provide a brighter, whiter light that allows the driver to fully see the road while driving in the dark.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though you may not know/have known the name of these lights, you know what Im talking about  when youre driving down the road, seeing all these continuous yellow lights, then one, which is nt yellow, all of a sudden catches your eye.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It has a slight blue tint to it, and it really stands out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thats what Im talking about: )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I consider Acura very considerate to include these because on many luxury cars, it s still an option.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, it enhances safety for the driver, his or her passengers, and other drivers on the road.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The specifications and conveniences of this car are practically endless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Please visit Acura at www.acura.com","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and perhaps request a brochure if you wish.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Perhaps through updates, I can add what features and conveniences I find to be worthy of posted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Conclusion","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In conclusion, this car is worth its every penny, because it comes very loaded with everything standard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is nothing really I could nt ask for in this car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If youre looking for a combination of performance, luxury, and convenience, this is the car for you!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, if youre looking more into performance, and are willing to shell out a few more thousands, then I would maybe consider Lexuss IS300.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Competing Models","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are interested in this car, I would recommend you also check out its competing models, as I dont really know your tastes and interests in vehicles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though I do own this car and love it to death, I still, and always have, envied Lexuss IS300 ( as is evidenced by my constant comparisons/references to it throughout this review ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though it looks to be styled towards a younger generation, it still is an awesome car, despite that it may be a bit more since not everything is standard with the IS300, like it is with the CL.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If theres any specific item you would like me to review about the CL, please post a comment or feel free to e-mail me at

windows, locks and mirrors, cruise control, AM/FM CD player, sunroof and leather seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is quite an impressive list of standard equipment for a base model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior of the Acura 3.2CL is very particular; it comes with twin sets of bucket seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's right this is not a mistake, you have two bucket seats in the front and to in the rear.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I must admit that I have never seen this in a coupe before, the closest

the rear that looked like semi buckets seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As I mentioned earlier the Acura CL comes fully loaded, since it is not a very big automobile you may think how did the engineers at Acura manage with all those controls and gages.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Every controls are easy to reach for the driver and also quite easy to

this the Acura 3.2CL is an excellent automobile and quite recommendable for anyone looking for a car that has bucket seats in the rear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The # 1 thing I look

negative"},{"sentence":"And the A/C on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over hilly roads.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Suffice it to say I didn?t think this was a fair test.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After this initial drive, I kept putting off a second test drive due to news that this or that sport package would be available in?a few months,?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"culminating in early releases about an SVT model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"SVT, a Ford unit that tunes select models for top performance, could be expected to get the most out of the Focus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I decided to wait.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Initially the SVT Focus was going to be introduced in November 2001, but didn?t actually appear until spring 2002.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When it did, I was there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Styling and Accommodations","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I won?t even try to describe the Focus?s styling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It?s so unique, I suspect virtually everyone is familiar with its complex blend of edges, character lines, and curves, and either loves or hates the overall effect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually, I?m a bit on the fence, but inclined toward the?love? camp when the car is fitted with alloy wheels, especially the thick-spoked sixteen-inchers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SVT has even larger wheels, but with their thin spokes they are less distinctive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for body styles, the round front end works best with the hatchbacks, okay with the sedan, and clashes with the boxy rear of the wagon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior styling is nearly as unconventional.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Initially the ZTS model included woodgrain trim, which was very out of place.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I hope this had changed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SVT, thankfully, includes fairly subdued trim pieces.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The basic design is wild enough without?help.?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The major problem I had with the interior was the poor fit of the power window buttons and a piece of window trim on the driver?s","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"door.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From what I?ve read, the Focus has had a number of quality problems, and, judging from the car I drove, these seem to be continuing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The best thing about the Focus?s interior are the seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the SVT, these have nice-looking blue cloth down the center? I suspect to hold the driver in place better than leather would?and black leather on the bolsters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The front seats are very comfortable and supportive, though I personally would not mind even more aggressive bolsters.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Rotary adjustments are provided for lumbar and recline on both front seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These might be more awkward to use than levers, but they allow you to get the setting exactly where you want it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lack, rubber ringed knobs don?t hurt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The driver?s seat has a single electric adjustment, for the height of the rear of the cushion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This adjusts the tilt of the seat cushion even more than it affects seat height.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My father, along for the test drive, noted the perfectly placed grab handles on the doors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once the driver starts doing crazy stuff the front passenger is going to appreciate the bracing these handles enable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I drove a Pontiac Vibe immediately after driving the Focus, and its doors included no such handle, only an indent in the armrest too shallow and too far to the rear to do any good.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My father felt this was inexcusable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Forward visibility is excellent, largely because the seating position is a few inches higher than in the average car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Visbility to the rear is somewhat obstructed by the dipping roof and pinched rear window ( courtesy of those snazzy high-mounted taillights ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A wheel that both tilts and telescopes ( without detents ) combines with the seat adjustments to permit just about anyone to find a perfect driving position.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Focus, especially in hatchback form, is not a large car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"At 168 inches in length, it?s","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"about 20 inches shorter than they typical family car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The amount of legroom and the general comfort of the rear seat thus come as a great surprise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even with 43 inches of front legroom, two more than the typical car, there are 37.6 inches of rear legroom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is just a couple tenths shy of the much larger Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In terms of total legroom, the Focus beats those cars.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"?Compact??","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In terms of shoulder room, yes, but four adults will be happy here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sometimes rear seat room is cheated by positioning the rear seat low to the floor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not in the Focus.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The rear seat is high enough to provide good thigh support to average-sized adult men, something that cannot be said about many larger cars.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This rear seat room does have a minor price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The optional sunroof ( $ 595 ) is fairly small so that it does n?t","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"reduce headroom for rear seat passengers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The price isn?t bad, but it?s","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"so small that I?m not sure I?d spring for it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cargo room is a mixed bag.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Especially with the rear seat folded, cargo space is generous.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That is, unless you need to carry a longish object ( a double stroller in my case ) across the width of the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even without the 8? subwoofer that comes with the $ 675 Audiophile package, but especially with it, the cargo area is narrow.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Minimal rear overhang permits this 168?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"car to have a 103? wheelbase.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This long wheelbase is great for passenger room and chassis stability, but means that the rear wheelwells intrude into the cargo area all the way to the rear of the car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the longer sedan the trunk extends past the wheelwells, so more width is available.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sadly, the SVT comes only as a two-door hatch for now, and while the salesman said a five-door hatch SVT should be available next spring an SVT sedan does n?t seem to be on the boards.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This makes a great deal of sense, as the hatches are by far the sportiest looking Foci, but people who need to carry long objects without folding the rear seat ( i.e.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"people with young children ) better just forget about the SVT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the Road","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SVT?s most apparent difference is its powertrain.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the engine is no larger, variable valve timing is employed to boost horsepower from 130@5300 RPM to 170@7000.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Torque gets a smaller boost, from 135@4500 to 145@5500.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These numbers tell much of the engine?s","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"story: you?re going to have to work it to extract any power, and, with the redline at 7200 RPM, you?re going to have to shift soon after hitting the power peak, dropping you back to about 150 horses.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Power delivery is very linear, with no obvious surges or dips due to alterations in the intake or valve timing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"During my test drive the engine never felt weak, but it never felt all that powerful either.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Generally it makes just enough power to be entertaining.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This isn?t necessarily a bad thing: this level of power, just enough to have fun, tends to make a car fun to drive at legal speeds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The engine does make nice noises for a four.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At least you?d better like them, because even when cruising down the street you hear this engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It?s not obnoxiously loud, but it?s","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"never silent.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"At 70 in sixth the engine is turning 3000 RPM.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SVT includes a unique six-speed manual transmission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( An automatic is not available. )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Unique among Foci in offering six speeds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unique in general in that these six speeds are obtained by using two final drive ratios.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don?t quite understand how this works, but it does.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even though you?re effectively shifting two gears with many shifts, this shifter was flat-out excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Effort is fairly light, but notchy enough to provide the clear sensation of shifting real gears rather than playing a video game.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I cannot recall a better-feeling shifter in a front-wheel-drive car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The clutch is also excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Together, they combined to provide effortless smooth shifts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With many manuals ( even excellent ones like in the 2003 Acura CL-S) I have had to drive the car for a while before I learned how to modulate the clutch and throttle to get seamless shifts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not here.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now we get to that area of the car I?m personally most interested in: handling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even with my high expectations, the Focus SVT surprised me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The steering is perfectly weighted, quick, and amazingly sharp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I felt directly connected to the road through this wheel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( Perhaps a bit too directly: in the car I drove the wheel vibrated back and forth at highway speeds?hopefully rebalancing the wheels fixes this. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I recall similarly sharp steering only in sports cars such as the Mazda Miata and BMW M Coupe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This steering makes the Focus feel even smaller than it is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A go-kart comes to mind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sharp steering is only the beginning of the handling equation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a front-wheel-drive car the Focus SVT has an extremely balanced chassis.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Despite the aggressive tuning this chassis feels very stable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Understeer is minimal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A very welcome surprise: torque steer is absent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I accelerated hard with and without the wheels turned, yet never felt the engine tug the steering wheel.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Despite the tall body, lean in turns is minimal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 215/45-17 tires grip the road strongly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of these elements come together to yield a car that is both safe and entertaining to drive aggressively.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SVT has larger brakes than pedestrian Foci.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They provide excellent feedback and a great deal of stopping power.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Alas, all is not perfect with this chassis.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The sharp responses and minimal lean come at a price: the ride is awful, perhaps the worst of any car I?ve reviewed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once again the Miata and M Coupe come to mind as the only real competition.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You feel and hear every expansion joint.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Larger road imperfections sometimes cause the front suspension to sharply react.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A very solid feeling structure compensates a bit, but not enough.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A little rearward compliance would be helpful here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As it stands, I?m not sure I could deal with the Focus SVT as a daily driver.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The SVT?s chassis has been tuned for those who want the sharpest possible handling, no matter what this costs in terms of ride quality.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Be sure to try thoroughly before you buy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A non-SVT Focus, with higher profile tires and more suspension compliance, will be better suited to the great majority of people.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pricing","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A base Focus SVT stickers for $ 17,995 ( all prices with destination charge ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even fully loaded like the car I test drove it only runs $ 19,660.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you?re looking for a high-performance car that can hold four adults, and either don?t care about ride quality or only drive on smooth roads, then this price is a bargain for what you get.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A similarly equipped Sentra Spec-V comes close at $ 18,288 ( with ABS and side airbags?standard on the Focus SVT), but is a more juvenile package that I suspect does not approach the handling finesse of the Ford.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A Civic Si, with less power and 15? wheels?but with a standard sunroof?runs","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"$19,710.00 ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A GTI 1.8T offers much more mid-range torque and a nicer interior, but soggier, less stable handling, for $ 19,860 ( with 17? wheels ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Those willing to sacrifice a little performance for a better ride can save a couple grand by going with the regular Focus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A?ZX3 power premium?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"with optional anti-lock brakes ( $ 400 ) and side airbags ( $ 350 ), stickers for $ 16,020.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This model includes a 6-disc CD player as standard equipment ( it?s part of the optional Audiophile package for the SVT).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can save another grand by doing without power windows/locks/mirrors, keyless entry, and the CD changer, but this does n?t","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"seem like a good trade to me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet another grand can be saved by doing without A/C, cruise, the tile/telescoping wheel, and the 16-inch wheels, but now you?re talking crazy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Basically, the upgraded engine, suspension, and seats of the SVT package cost $ 2,000.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not pocket change, but a more than fair price is you?re into the tradeoffs involved.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Last Words","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Focus SVT surprised me in many ways, most good, some not so good.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Overall, it offers a unique driving experience, a highly tuned car right out of the box.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As I?d hoped, handling is excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, the price for this handling includes a ride so bad I?m not sure I could personally live with it, at least not on Michigan?roads.? If you want the sharpest handling practical hatch, period, then this is your car.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you care at all about a smooth ride, you?ll probably be happier elsewhere, either in a regular Focus or a VW.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Imac is horrible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sure it looks nice but we are talking about a computer not an office ornament.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For those who are looking to buy a computer that is technologically advance and will last at least a couple of years before it becomes worthless LOOK ELSEWHERE and don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of junk.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I could write a huge book on why the iMac is a bad computer, but to be brief here are a some of the big problems with the Imac:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"1 ) Over Heating","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The IMac has no fan on the processor which means on really hot days your computer could possibly over heat and shut down.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Worse comes to worse your processor can get fried making your computer worthless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also because the iMac compacts everything in that little case there is overheating with all the other hardware parts which could cost you in performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also since there is no fan on the processor the processor is running at a slower speed then it technically could which means that there is wasted hardware potential.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In a nutshell the Imac heats up a lot faster then normal computers which is bad for your computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Besides why would you want your computer to be releasing massive amounts of heat on a hot summer day","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2 ) Hardware sucks","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Try using the DVD drive it is so flimsy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is bound to brake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It doesn't even come out all the way when you press the button.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is no floppy disk.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The speakers suck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The mouse and keyboard are horrible see my section on Ergonomics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Can't upgrade to anything see can't upgrade.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"3 ) Lack of Software","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As with all Apple computers very few developers make software for Macs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even when they do the software comes out months or years after it has come out for PCs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Go in to a computer store and look at the software sections for both PCs and Macs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You will soon see the difference.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mac holds such a small part of the computer market that there is little profit and incentive for companies to make software for Macs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want lots of software (especially games ), then buy a PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"4 ) Can't Upgrade","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is next to impossible to upgrade an imac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Open up the case and look.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You be lucky if you can locate anything.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just about every Pc can be upgraded.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plus even if you could there is almost nothing to upgrade to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While Pcs have tons of hardware upgrades (video cards, sound cars... ) availble, macs have next to none.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You are suck with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"5 ) Ergonomics","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before you buy try out the new Imac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You will find that the mouse and keyboard are Ergonomicly painful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The mouse and keyboard are too small to fit your hands and will make your hand hurt after a couple of minutes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Never have I used a more uncomfortable mouse or keyboard.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"6 ) Price/Performance","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sure you have all heard that macs are twice as fast a Pcs at least.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Too bad the test was done by Byte Mag. a product of apple.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sure in some intences they are a bit faster but most times they lag far back in performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have comparing the parts of an iMac with a Compaq Pc in the same price range to prove that the iMac is not worth it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Pc","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A) Costs:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pc - $ 1299 ( complete system w/ printer )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Imac - $ 1299","target":"Genuine

drive:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pc - 17 GB","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Imac - 10 GB","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"E) Monitor:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pc - 17","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mac - 15 in","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"F) Results when software was run on both:","target":"Genuine

graphics program )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pc - 6 sec","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mac - 5 sec","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As you can see, the iMac is not worth it the high price or the trouble.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I urge you to get a pc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However if you are a Mac lover get a new G4 instead of the Imac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let me start off this review by first stating that the iMacDV I own is the 1999 model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I bought the computer, I was awestruck taking it out of the box.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was sooo cute!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was also incredibly easy to set up, I was on my way after plugging in only a couple of cords.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, after having the mac for a short while I began to notice its downfalls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"1 ) Can you say no space?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was a film major in college, and I loved the idea of being able to edit my school projects on my computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Until I realized only about 10 minutes of footage would fit on my hard drive before the computer would freeze.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had no idea of the compatibility issues that existed when I bought my computer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Final Cut Pro wont even run on it for lack of space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2 ) My modem\"went bad\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have now owned my mac for two years, and one day when trying to sign on to AOL, it decided I no longer had a modem.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I tried reloading AOL, checking the system extensions, and just about everything else that I could possibly think of before I called the local Mac repair shop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Two days letter I got the following message on my answering machine:\" Turns out your modem has gone bad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want us to replace the faulty modem, the modem cost is $ 120 and the price for labor is $ 75\" OUTRAGEOUS!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have decided to not get my computer fixed, and to save up until I have the ability to buy a G4.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"UPDATE Turns out it was not my modem that was the problem, I have a faulty logic board.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is quite a bit worse of a problem, as there is no way to fix it, without paying more than my computer is worth.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"ARGH.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I will never sign on to the internet again with my iMac.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It kind of makes me wonder why the\"i\" in iMac stands for\"internet\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"3)fast processor?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A pox on whomever believes the hype about how much faster Mac processers are than PCs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can't speak for other Macs, but my PC was much faster than my Mac, and it had a couple more years on it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"4)DV Drive Problems","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know how many of you have taken a gander at the Mac home page, but at the bottom in very small print is the notice for a civil suit against Mac, requiring them to give upgrades to all of their G3s and iMacs built prior to 2000.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I hadn't thought of buying a much higher model, and scrolled down on their home page, I never would have known, nor would I ever have been able to get the upgrade, as the time limit for upgrading expires on Nov 12th, 2001.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"( 10 days after I saw the notice )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"5)User friendly?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know if its because I've played with PCs all my life, but the iMac was anything but user friendly when it came to anything other than standard operations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've had difficulty with so many different applications, its impossible to list them all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"AND the iMac doesn't come with a support booklet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are having problems with an application, you have to use a less-than-reliable computer searching HELP device.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also doesn't help that they have online support when your computer's modem has\"gone bad\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was so excited when I was given an iMac for my birthday last year, especially since it is aqua blue.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I have found lots of flaws with this computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First of all, it doesn't have a disk drive ( the hard square disks ), you have to buy that seperately ( which runs about 100$! ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I couldn't transfer any files from my old computer onto my new iMac without buying extra stuff!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was also not happy with the DVD player, it isn't fast enough to keep up with the DVD itself!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The actors lines will go in and out of being dubbed correctly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is only a slight problem, but it really aggravates me to the point that I have only watched one DVE on it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only that, this computer has frequent crashes ( about once every week or so ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That is a problem in itself, but to make matters worse there is no set of keys that you can press to restart the computer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You have to hold down the power button for about ten seconds for the computer to turn off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A few times even that hasn't worked and I actually had to unplug my computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, the computer does have a lot of memory, it is pretty quick, and is good if you don't constantly have to import and export things from your computer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The tech support is very helpful too...however, I have WAY too many friends there considering this is supposed to be a very reliable computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, I wouldn't suggest this computer, espcially since the world is being run more and more by PC's now ( I cannot down load files unless they are in a MAC format...very frustrating ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was going to purchase one of the new $ 1199 mid-range iMacs for my 19 month old son to bang on, I wanted it primarily as a DVD equipped monitor so that he could watch\" Baby Shakespear\" DVDs in the nursery.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But Apple decided to replace the DVD player with a cd Burner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yeah, like my son is going to rip and burn his own cd's!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He has mastered banging on the keyboard and wiggling the mouse with Toddler Disney!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But downloading Mp3s and burning will have to wait at least until he is three!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Digital Video feature is virtually useless with the 20GB hard drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If there were absolutely no system files on the drive, that would allow for approximately one hour of captured digital video.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I guess you can convert the file into an Mpeg1 on a 650MB CD-R, and make VCDs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I can do that on a $ 550 PIII much easier and faster, even with analog video if I don't want to pay $ 1000 for a digital camcorder.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'll have to purchase a used iMac with a DVD player.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Or I can do what Apple want's me to do, get the $ 3,499 G4 with a Superdrive to play DVD's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I might as well get the $ 2,999 Cinema display while I'm at it!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Gee, I wonder if I can plug in my old 1985 Apple IIc\" Superdrive\", ah, but it dosn't support DVD either!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I purchased this product because I like\" thinking different.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was really sick of Windoze! I was originally going to get an iBook but the features in the iBook pale in comparison to the iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I went to CompUSA and bought a blueberry one, BIG MISTAKE.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I got the computer home and I thought it was great until I saw two little black dots towards the bottom of the screen.","target":"Genuine

it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When connected to the USB port it detected well, but no matter where I placed the receiver it did not communicate with the keyboard and mouse well.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I finally decided to return it, but this is another story, found below.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The DVD-ROM could have been either a

problems where the system appears to lock up, and I am preparing to save all of my data and reload the operating system and the programs I want.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would encourage new buyers to do this themselves, before putting any data onto the drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I will discuss the method to do so further down this

always requiring more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And other than being some of the lowest quality Dell memory for a computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is where

every other manufacturer of motherboard is not afraid to give knowledgeable or trained individuals the capability to enter the bios settings.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But then again, some people need to hide the truth.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most, if not all microboards have around 2 PCI slots and an AGP slot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They

positive"},{"sentence":"We highly recommend NOT fully decking out your G5.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We ordered a $ 6,000 souped up model ( maximum hard drive, RAM, processors, etc. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It worked briefly each time we picked it up after repair.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We knew immediately that it should not rev up like a jet engine immediately upon booting and never slow down.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It has frozen up, failed to recognize the operating system, take fifteen minutes to boot up...you name it, it hasn't worked.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We do massive Final Cut Pro editing and looked forward to the machined used to create\" Finding Nemo.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Last night, we bought our 8th external hard drive so we could back up the one drive that is working on our G5.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are trying it out with the original hard drive ( smaller, but if it works, fine with us ) to see if it can find its brain again.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We are about to seek a refund for our $ 6,000 purchase.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If it worked, it would be worth it... because when it does work, it is a productivity dream.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But it's now a nightmare","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It pains me to rate my iMac so low because I have been a Mac booster for many years, after converting from a PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I will say up front that I am not a computer nerd and need something simple that I can operate without reading a lot of books or going to school.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A long time ago I returned a new desktop PC to Gateway because I couldn't operate it intuitively ( my fault ), and Gateway graciously took it back, no questions asked.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I then bought a new little Mac 160 notebook and was immediately able to operate it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I used it for years until it finally smoked its motherboard and had to be replaced.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The next computer was another Mac notebook, a 5300 CS, which was not one of Apples finest products, but nonetheless it was fairly efficient and easy to operate.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It finally lost the top half of its color LCD and ran out of memory and I was again forced to buy a new computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The jazzy new iMac looked like just the ticket.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I now own iMac serial number 0T213E6FMAY.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My iMac was trouble from the start and I got no help from Apple other than advice, and after 90 days I couldn't even get that unless I forked over an extra [ $ $ $ ] for an extended warranty, which I did.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Here are just a few of my complaints:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The iMac functions pretty much like a PC and is no longer as intuitive as the earlier Apple products they built their ease of operation reputation on.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"2. At times the screen locks up, the\" OFF\" button won't work, and the only way to shut it down is to unplug it from the wall.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"3. The\" OFF\" button is located near the left-back of the body in a hard-to-reach place, accessible only with the left hand, not the right, a very poorly thought out location.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"4. There is no\" ON-OFF\" switch on the keyboard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"5. The so-called\"SLEEP\" function doesn't always work like it should, certainly not like the earlier notebooks.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It sometimes awakens hung up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"6. Sometimes when the shut-down command is given it only goes into the sleep mode, can't be shut down by the\" OFF\" button, and has to be unplugged from the wall for a forced shut-down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On re-booting after such a forced shut down the system has to go through an automatic hard drive assessment before it is again functional.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even after such a shutdown and hard drive assessment the system sometimes doesn't work right.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"7. Apple has loaded so much unnecessary\"bloatware\" bells and whistles into their OX10 and 9.2.2 operating systems there is no way an ordinary user can operate it easily.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even my paid Apple authorized technicians have had difficulties working out the wrinkles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I never know what to expect next.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"8. The optical mouse clicker was too sensitive, even at full adjustment for firmer spring resistance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I replaced it with a Logitech optical mouse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After years of using Apple products I may go back to a PC because my iMac no longer offers the advantages Macs once had over PC's.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It doesn't matter to me if the problems stem from Apple software or hardware; the trouble remains and is still real.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Software unready for the market is just as bad as a defective motherboard design.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A top notch professional computer technician recently told me that Mr. Steve Jobes' tech meddling is responsible for the newest G4 Macs no longer operating with the traditional intuitive ease of the earlier Macs, to say nothing of the continual technical glitches.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have heard similar complaints from other iMac owners.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You won't see this in the advertising, and some iMac users are reluctant to admit the weaknesses of their expensive new toys.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am not one of them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For a person on a semi-limited budget, I wanted a computer that would give me the most bang for the buck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was my first computer purchase.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I knew ( or at least I THOUGHT I knew ) that I couldnt get a decent Windows PC for about a grand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All I heard was how powerful and easy Mac's are to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I decided on the iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've had it a couple weeks, and after a few incidents that made me want to kick the thing out the window, I am now writing this review with a cool and logical head.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i want to do an illusion and reality comparison of this computer...this is based on the research I did on the Mac before buying it, and the reality of the darn thing that Im living with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Illusion: the Mac is a powerful computer that is easy to setup and use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fact: its not really all that powerful or easy to setup. the sales guy told me I'd be ready to go right out of the box.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yeah right.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I know, Im naive...like I said i never bought a computer before.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For something so powerful, it certainly does NOT like to do more than one application at once.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"IFor example, if you are using iTunes to import songs onto the hard drive and want to go on to the internet, forget it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"its slow as molasses.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As a matter of fact, the only application that works at regular speed with another application running is the stupid chess game.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its not even specifically with iTunes...try running any two applications and everything slows down to snail's pace.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Illusion: the imac comes with a 56K modem for decent internet connection speed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Reality: it will never connect at higher than 32K.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Calls to Earthlink and Apple Care Support say there's nothing really that can be done about it, unless i can eliminate all the supposed line noise in the phone system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I use to own a webtv unit, and to be honest, webtv was faster than the imac is for accessing internet pages from the same phone line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i dont know, I pick up the phone and I dont hear any noise whatsoever.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Illusion: Mac OS X is the best OS thing to come along since sliced bread.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fact: This stupid OS X in incredibly slow and frustrating to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I believe that the OS X is mostly responsible for the turtle like speed of the system, it does run better in 9.1.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also needs to switch freqently between X and 9.1 to run some applications.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"this also takes up more time and slows everything down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And Im sorry, I hate the friggin dock.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's too big and gets in the way of everything Im trying to do.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I know you can reduce it in size, but then when I get it to the point where its not blocking scroll bars or Appleworks controls, its too small to read.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It has a hiding function, and the dock pops up when the mouse is on the bottom of the screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That seems to be the best option, though sometimes it doesnt respond properly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and for some reason, every time I restart ot shut down the computer, all of my icons are re-aranged on the desktop in weird locations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Whats up with that????","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"illusion: iTunes is a revolutionary music program.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"fact: it would be great if you could just copy a CD straight up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But no...you have to import the whole CD to your hard drive, make a seperate playlist for it, burn it, than delete everything-one song at a time so you dont overcrowd the HD.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a drag.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While im on the subject, the volume control for this thing sucks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"its like there's 5 settings: Off, loud, louder, loudest, and deafening.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not good for late night listening in the house when all are asleep.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, the CD eject button only seems to work when it feels like it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It malfunctions at least 1 out of every 3 attempts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and why?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, because the manual says you have to quit all other applications first.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"HUH?!?!?!? Im no computer genious, but how much friggin memory is needed to eject a CD? Come on!!!!! Another example of the multi-tasking suckiness of this thing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also on my list of complaints are not enough USB ports ( 2 ), and Apple Care Support.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Why the support staff?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, when you call them they give you the impression that you are an idiot if you dont know this stuff already.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had once person laugh at me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not very professional, no matter how bad I screwed up.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I didnt pay 150 bucks for a warranty to be made fun of.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A-holes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I will probably update this review when the OS 10.1 update comes out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Supposedly it will speed up the system quite a bit...we'll see.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As it stands, I would not recommend the iMac to anyone, especially if you need a computer that can do more than one thing at a time effectively.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This thing just sucks at multi-tasking, theres no better way to put.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For the money, I imagine you could get something WAY better than this overpriced-for-what-it-does machine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I could do it again, I would have bought the iMac model for 999, and upgraded the memory later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This thing is not as fast as i was led to believe.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I also was disappoined in the lack of a DVD-rom drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I feel kind of ripped off and misguided in making this purchase.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I guess theres a reason Windows PC's are so popular, they just seem to work better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Quite frankly, I think this iMac is a piece of junk.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'd take it back were it not for those stupid open-box fees.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'll live with it for the next 3 years, just not happily.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"please, do shop around before you consider buying this thing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mac has fashioned a prettier toaster in the form of its new desktop, but unfortunately, the toast does not taste better.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My difficulties with using this product are numerous, and the fact that Mac has only 5 % of the market share on computers is fully understandable; they make a terrible product that is not very compatible with standard software, the Microsoft Office Suite of applications.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"First, there is no scroll-to-zoom feature.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This means that the mouse wheel cannot be used to zoom in and out ( enlarge or minimize ) a document for editing, proofing, or viewing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"More insulting, no mouse driver is available on the internet to install this essential feature that is STANDARD on Windows machines.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Many sites offer such a driver, but I have yet to find one that works at all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To this end, I purchased 3 mouse accessories and none were able to zoom within a document.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, assigning shortcut keys to applications by way of the tools menu causes the machine to lock up, necessitating rebooting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Assigning shortcuts keys are essential for more proficient computer users.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thus, this is a debilitating fault.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Worse, word and excel seem to lack features that are standard devices on the PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Standard shortcut key assignments in word applications are not cross-application translatable in Excel or PowerPoint, although these three applications appear in a suite for purchase and are most compatible in this manner on a PC!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Mac product seems to persist like an uninvited houseguest, overstaying its welcome or utility.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Frankly, Mac has made my job more difficult or downright impossible with inefficient document handling and un-user friendly filing systems.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, having to drag down a menu bar just to perform a function is a time-waster.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Almost everything on a PC is key-able.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No mouse is needed for the most common tasks, making usage a breeze for the more dexterous.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, the Macs horrible desktop display choices make me feel like a punished three-year-old.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I want to be able to alter every element of my desktop appearance ( including the way Word, PowerPoint, and Excel appear when I am working within these applications ) like I can on a PC?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What purpose does it serve to hold the Mac user hostage to someone elses factory preferences?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Finally, memory problems on the Mac abound, causing system crashes daily.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This does not contribute to productivity.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Mac causes problems, and solves no problems.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Technical support at Apple borders on IRS-style hostility.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was told that my brand new iMac was 8 years old, based on the serial number I gave the lady over the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She refused to help me past that point unless I bought support!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a rip-off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My department bought a useless desktop and now must spend more for dubious support.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have receive more support from old pantyhose!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Get real!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Can you afford to be rude to customers who comprise an ever dwindling share of the market?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I recommend that Apple go out of business ( and take their tacky support department with them ) and recall its awful products immediately.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Benefits:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For some reason, many people are recommending the iMAC DV+; however, they probably did not have my experience.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I admit it has improved: it now comes with a nicer keyboard, optical mouse and a 20 gig hard drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also admit that it is super easy to setup.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Bad News","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, this computer burns up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It runs extremely hot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I handled the purchase of one for my college newspaper and it burned up within two weeks of its arrival.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When it first came, I used it to save files on a CD and was amazed how hot the CD was when it came out; however, I dismissed this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then I felt the top of the computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was so hot it hurt to touch it!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I should have taken action then but I shut it off and let it cool down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A week later, I came in after it had been on for a few hours, with the screen saver on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room was hot and I could smell something.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I felt the heat on my face when I got close.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I tried to get the computer working by moving the mouse, the on light kept getting bright and fading, getting bright and fading; however, the screen never lit up.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I turned it off and tried to turn it on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The computer did not boot and has nt since.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is shot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Conditions","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has been recommended to me that I describe the conditions this computer was in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was in an air-conditioned office.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, it is important to note our G3s G4s and 2-year old iMACs are fine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This indicates that our conditions have nothing to do with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Good News","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fortunately, it was still under warranty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My Recommendation","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this computer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, if you already have one or insist on an Apple, I recommend that you minimize your use of it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, I spoke to a computer repairman who has worked with apple for years.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He remembers the Apples that had the monitor and computer combined, like the iMAC, which many people owned 10 years ago.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He said they ran too hot and would be ruined if they were on too long.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He suspects that they must have a similar setup.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He used to install a fan inside the old computers and thinks something like that will work now.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you really want one, it would probably be best to have a repairman install a fan like that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Bottom Line","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Im not a computer expert but I know money going up in smoke when I see it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Allright I looked at this little computer in the store a couple weeks ago hoping there would be an advancement over the first Imac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Besides a few minor upgrades that just barely met par with technology advancements there were no changes.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The sales rep made a big deal out of how there was no fan on the processor and that meant there was such advanced technology.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He did not realize he was talking to a man who is an overclocker at heart.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If there is no fan all that means is that if there was a fan on the processor then it could be run faster.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That means there is wasted hardware potential.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only do you pay more for these machines but they are set up so as not to take full potential of their power, which is still pretty limited.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The mouse design problems have not been fixed and I still think the thing looks like bas 70's art deco.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I don't think it is possible to overclock with the hardware in this machine.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They aren't made for adjustment and they just aren't that fast.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm sorry but this machine is just not worth it","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Why was I so drawn to the iMac?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You see, for the last 11 years I have been using Microsoft Windows-based machines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each version of Windows has been getting better, and XP in particular is quite good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, going into this purchase, I was quite happy with XP.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, roaming the aisles of CompUSA I felt myself being drawn to the iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a few reasons actually.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, I had continually heard that the Mac made it super easy to manage digital photos and create movies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Second, I found the design of the iMac very appealing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I still use a Windows machine for work, so I figured I would take a chance and buy an iMac to replace my Micron PC at home - and I haven't looked back since.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"INITIAL CONCERNS","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Prior to the purchase, I did a bit of research to ensure I wouldn't be making a big mistake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My home computer had been used primarily for managing photos, creating and editing Microsoft Office documents, videoconferencing (using Messenger in XP), and surfing the net.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the iMac, I wanted to add making movies to the repertoire.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One thing that I discovered that eased my decision was the fact that MS Office documents now share the same file format for Mac and PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My assumption was that the Mac version would require different file formats ( requiring a conversion at either end ), and this is not the case.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Discovering that I could create a Word, Excel or Powerpoint document and e-mail it to a PC without any worries was a beautiful thing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The other thing that was a concern was videoconferencing functionality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We have family on the other coast, and used the videoconferencing capability built into XP's Messenger to virtually visit these relatives.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The version of MSN Messenger for the Mac does not have this feature, which was initially a bit of a bummer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, there was an easy solution.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yahoo Messenger does have videoconferencing capabilities built-in, and works cross-platform ( Mac to PC ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition, the iSight camera that is available for the Mac is incredible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is auto-focus, and the image quality is excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yahoo also offers better video quality as compared to MSN and the built-in version of Messenger available with XP.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If there was one other thing I worried about, it was processor speed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Owning a PC for so many years gets you caught up in thinking about speed simply in terms of the processor speed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The new PC's were shipping with 3 GHz processors, and here I was contemplating the purchase of a machine with a 1 GHz processor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What was I thinking!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was told that the Mac and PC process information very differently, and the 1 GHz processor was equivalent to a much faster processor on the PC side.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I put a bit of faith in this explanation, and never let it get in the way of my purchase decision.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Once I found that MS Office and videoconferencing would work for me on the iMac - and put aside the processor speed concern - I got out the credit card.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually, I bought it from CompUSA and opened a CompUSA credit card account to get 5 % off my purchase as well as 6 months of no interest financing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They also gave me $ 50 toward the purchase of accessories, which I put toward the purchase of a Canon S400 ( which is phenomenal ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"OUT OF THE BOX","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One thing that really bugged me about my PC was the sheer number of cables, connectors and general mess it seemed to create on my desktop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was so nice taking the iMac out of the box, placing it on my desk, connecting the speakers, keyboard and Ethernet cable to the iMac, connecting the mouse to the keyboard, and done.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am stating the obvious when I say the iMac looked stunning.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It truly is a piece of art, and the build quality is very impressive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bottom of the iMac was even finished off beautifully with a circular piece of brushed aluminum ( which looks very much like a larger version of what you'd find on the back of a fine watch ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another aspect of the design that is very nice is the fact that the system is very ergonomically pleasing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is amazing how much more comfortable it is (especially at 6'3\" ) to have the screen up nice and high.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apple used a unique mounting system for the monitor which makes it easy to manipulate the screen placement with just one hand with very little effort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The range of movement is vast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Being tall, I have the screen very high, but someone who likes it lower can lower it all the way down so that the bottom of the screen is only a half inch from the surface of the desk!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From the highest to the lowest setting, there is a range of movement of 7.5 inches!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The LCD flat panel I had on my PC only pivoted up and down to adjust the viewing angle, but it offered no actual vertical movement as with the iMac.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I found that once I started using the iMac, I got way fewer headaches.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With my other monitor, even though the viewing angle was correct after it pivoted upward, I was still looking down at it quite a bit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This caused the back of my neck to strain after a while, which would sometimes lead to headaches.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The iMac monitor also pivots from side to side, which I haven't found all that useful - but I guess people will use it when they want to show others their work, etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"FEATURES","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The iMac is very full-featured, especially considering its diminutive size.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think anyone buying simply on specs will probably buy a PC, as they are leading the pack from a hardware per dollar standpoint.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was more concerned with real world usability.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, for those that must know, here are the specs:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"1 GHz PowerPC G4 Processor","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"133 MHz bus speed","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"17\" widescreen digital display","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"DVD/CD burner ( read: 32x CD/8 x DVD; burn: 8x CD-RW, 16x DD-R, 4x DVD-R )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"80GB 7200rpm Hard Drive","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"NVIDIA GeForce4 MX 64MB video card","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"256MB DDR SDRAM ( Max 1GB )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"56K V.92 internal modem","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2 Firewire ports","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2 available USB ports ( after the speakers, and keyboard/mouse are connected )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apple Pro Speakers ( the translucent round speakers )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is probably a good section to comment on the speed of the machine with the 1 GHz processor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I have no 3 GHz windows machine to directly compare it to, I can say that I now have no worries about performance.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Probably the most processor intensive task I have undertaken on the iMac is movie editing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For this, I found the iMac to be plenty fast, and at no time did I feel like I needed more speed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I really feel that the Mac world is more focused on usability than raw speed, as is the case with the PC world.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The PC world is filled with specs and benchmarks, and you don't see this nearly as often in the Mac world ( although you do see it ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The first thing I did to my iMac was to add memory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From a performance per dollar standpoint, nothing beats additional RAM.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I purchased a 512MB memory board from CompUSA for around $ 120 to bring the total memory up to 768MB.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have upgraded the memory in all the computers I have owned, so I didn't even bother trying the machine with the 256MB.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Therefore, I couldn't compare the iMac with the standard versus added memory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My recommendation would be for around $ 100 get the extra memory - it's a no brainer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"From a hardware perspective, I should also note that you can get an internal wireless card for the iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Airport Extreme wireless card for the iMac works with the AirPort Extreme Base Station using 802.11g for up to 54 Mbps, which is about 5 times faster than the currently most popular standard of 802.11b.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Airport Extreme Card is also compatible with 802.11b if you already have a wireless router based on the older standard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have a wireless network in my house, but have the iMac sitting next to the router.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Therefore, I just connected it with an Ethernet cable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, if I was to place it elsewhere in the house, the internal wireless feature would be nice as it would eliminate an external box.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have actually thought about putting it in the family room, and since it looks so nice, it would fit right into the decor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually, it would probably enhance it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another internal option for the iMac is a bluetooth adapter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, be aware that this option is only available if you buy your iMac directly through Apple - something I was not aware of prior to purchase!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Since I bought my machine through CompUSA, I wasn't able to get the internal bluetooth.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All is not lost however.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"First of all, I don't currently have a need for it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And second, you can buy a tiny D-Link DBT-120 bluetooth adapter that plugs into a USB port for about $ 50.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The D-Link adapter is tiny at 1.81\" x 0.73\" x 0.37\", so you just plug it in and you don't see it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One thing I would advise is to replace the Apple Pro Speakers with a better system if you are going to do a ton of music listening, as the Pro Speakers have absolutely zero low end.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So far, I have kept them - but I will replace them at some point.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"GETTING STARTED","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I turned on the machine and went through the setup procedure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In a matter of minutes, all the necessary information the machine needed was entered, and it had auto-discovered my internet connection.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was ready to roll.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When first using the iMac, one word comes to mind, and that is\" slick\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything looks so nice and crisp and stylish.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The way the icons look, and the way the applications launch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's all, well, very slick!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 17\" widescreen display is absolutely stunning.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The images seem to jump off the screen they are so lifelike.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unlike most PC's that convert the digital image to analog, where it is sent through a cable to the monitor, the iMac display has a direct digital connection to the video card.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The high-quality of the monitor combined with the digital connection is what makes the monitor look the way it does.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I started playing around with the applications, and they were very intuitive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyone used to a Windows machine will find it very easy to use the Mac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sure, it is slightly different, but the general concepts of pulldown menus are the same.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The one thing I did notice however is that I missed a 2-button mouse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have no idea why Apple choose not to include a 2-button mouse on this machine, as the OS X operating system supposedly does support 2-button mouse operation ( although it supposedly doesn't offer as extensive support for 2-button operation as compared to Windows ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The mouse it ships with actually doesn't have any buttons at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Rather, you simply push down on the mouse itself and the whole mouse\"is\" the button.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since you can use any portion of the mouse to click, I found myself\" thinking\" that I had clicked the right side and waiting for a menu to pop up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, that was not the case, as there really was no second button to click.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have contemplated buying a 2-button mouse, but the mouse it ships with matches the unit and looks so darn nice with it that I haven't bothered up to this point.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I figure Apple will eventually smarten up and offer a 2-button version.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another area where the iMac was lacking was in user switching.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My wife and I had separate user accounts on the XP machine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We could switch back and forth on the XP machine, leaving applications open.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When we switched back, anything we were working on would still be there, ready to work on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the Mac and OS X ( also called Jaguar ), you need to completely log off ( and close all applications ) in order to switch between users.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This may not seem like a big deal, but if you are both home throughout the day, and want to jump on the computer from time to time, it becomes an annoyance.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The good news is that the next version of software, called Panther, is due out from Apple on 10/24/03.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Panther adds a number of features, and one of them is user switching similar in functionality to XP.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One other minor issue that took me a little time to get used to was the differences between the\"home\" and\"end\" keys.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the Mac, the\"home\" key takes you to the beginning of a document versus the beginning of the line with a PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The\"end\" key on the Mac takes you to the end of the document versus the end of the line with a PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To go to the beginning or end of the line on the Mac, you need to use the up and down arrow keys.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Minor quibbles of course, but anyone used to Windows would find it a bit confusing at first - in practice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other than the issues mentioned above, I found the iMac and OS X to be very easy to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Keep in mind, this was just basic usability, nothing application specific.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Read on to find out how the iMac stacked up from an applications standpoint.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"APPLICATIONS","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The iLife suite of applications ( which come with the iMac ) was one reason I went with the iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This includes iMovie, iTunes, iPhoto and iDVD.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To summarize each application:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iMovie - import movies from your camcorder and edit them","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iPhoto - import, manage, edit and print photos, easily order prints or photo albums","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iDVD - put your iMovie projects on DVD and/or create DVD-based slideshows of your photos from iPhoto","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iTunes - import, manage music from your CD's or downloaded music","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since the iLife applications are so central to the iMac experience, I wanted to really focus on them from the standpoint of\"how\" I use them and how easy they are to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I really wanted to make movies from the footage I took on my digital camcorder.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also wanted to better manage my digital photos.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found it to be exhausting and tedious to try to find the best application for doing these things on the PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were way too many choices.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If people were raving about the Apple applications and how easy they were to use, and I didn't have to go on a search to find the best movie application, best photo application, etc., I would be very happy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So after playing around with the iMac and getting a feel for it, the next day I focused on the iLife applications.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over the past few years, I have accumulated many hours worth of video featuring my now 2 year old son.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had been itching to put them on DVD, but it seemed like such a chore.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did fool around a little on the PC trying to make a movie, but I didn't find it all that intuitive, and it seemed a little flaky.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"About an hour after launching iMovie, my first DVD was DONE, and it looked GREAT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It even had transition effects ( e.g.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"fade in, fade out ), titles and credits, and a few songs I imported from some CD's!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was so easy you cannot even imagine.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I simply connected my JVC MiniDV camcorder and pressed a button to import the footage.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The iMovie application seems to detect the various points in the video where I stopped and started recording.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So different pieces of footage that I took on the same tape were stored on the\" storyboard\" as individual clips.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then I simply took the individual clips and dragged them into a timeline at the bottom of the screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One clip would run into the other.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, if I wanted to put in a transition effect between the two clips, I simply selected from a list of effects and dragged the effect icon between the two clips on the timeline.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Super easy, and super intuitive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can name each clip, then see a list of the clip names in order to build a\"scene selection\" for a DVD ( same as the scene selection feature on DVD's you rent ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I then used iDVD to burn my movie, and I was loving life.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The experience of making my first movie exceeded any and all expectations I had going into the process.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for performance, it was great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would describe it as very responsive, and at no time did I wish it was faster.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"iPhoto and iTunes are equally as impressive as iMovie and iDVD.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iPhoto stores all your photos in a library.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After your photos are stored in the library ( which by default is organized by\"roll\" of digital film which is dated and can be renamed to whatever you'd like ), you create albums.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You then select pictures from the library and drag them into an album.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can edit the pictures in the album, and also have a copy of the original stored in the library if you ever want to revert to the original image.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have found iPhoto to be very easy to use and have not even scratched the surface of its capabilities.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For instance, I know you can put in descriptions of individual photos, then search all of iPhoto for photos that contain a keyword.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The nice thing is that iPhoto presents you with a super simple and clean interface.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The advanced features are there, but they aren't\"in your face\" like they are with PC applications.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once I got some pictures from my digicam into iPhoto, I also found out how easy it was to e-mail photos to my friends.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With my PC, e-mailing photos that were compressed down to a manageable file size was a big pain.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would open the photo, resize is, save it as a compressed JPEG, then open Outlook and attach the images to an e-mail and send it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was a labor intensive process.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With iPhoto, you simply select the photos you want to send, then press the e-mail icon at the bottom of the iPhoto interface.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It brings up a window which allows you to select a size of small, medium, large or full size as well as two check boxes asking whether you want to include comments or titles, and that's it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I usually select medium ( which is 640 x 480 ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So in other words, I select the photos, click e-mail, click\"medium\", then press\" compose\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This automatically opens up an e-mail with the photos attached, at which time I write my e-mail text and hit send.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So easy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iPhoto also makes it extremely easy for the novice to post their photos to their own internet site with the addition of the.Mac service, but more on that later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lastly, you can click on\"order prints\" or\"order book\" to get your photos professionally processed or to order a hard-bound book containing the photos from any of your albums.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you order prints, the order is handled by Kodak.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not sure who makes the albums, as I have not done this yet, but they look beautiful.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They are hard bound and covered in linen in a variety of colors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A 10 page album will run about $ 30.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Prints are $ 0.49","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"for 4 x 6, $ 0.99 for 5 x 7, $ 3.99 for 8 x 10 and go all the way up to $ 19.99 for a 20 x 30.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These services are commonplace for PC users, but the fact that they are so tightly integrated into iPhoto makes the process of ordering them MUCH easier.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It takes so little time that it is actually fun versus a laborious task.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iTunes along with the Apple Music Store makes it a pleasure to get into music on your computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is something that has been intriguing to me, but have never done it because it isn't all that intuitive on the PC.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's not that it isn't possible.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's just that I never wanted to take the steps to learn.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With iTunes, there is no learning.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You just pop a CD in, iTunes opens, and you can either listen to it or drag songs into your music library.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It couldn't be easier.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iTunes works like iPhoto in terms of having a library and then playlists ( equivalent to albums in iPhoto ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All your music gets placed into the library, then you create playlists which organize the music in the library.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I may drag one song into my\" Mellow\" playlist, and another in my\" Classical Music\" playlist.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You name the playlists however you want, and organize them accordingly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another very nice feature of iTunes is that along with your library and playlists, iTunes also has a\" Music Store\" icon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Select this icon and it connects directly into Apples online music download service called the Apple Music Store.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beauty of this is that it doesn't open an internet browser, necessitating a second interface to deal with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rather, the music is right there in iTunes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When your music library or playlists are selected, the search bar at the top of iTunes lets you search your own music for a group or a song.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you select the Music Store, the same search bar lets you search their online database.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want to buy a song, you do it right within iTunes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After the song is downloaded, you can simply drag it into one of your playlists just like any other song.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is very simple, and very easy to do.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Notice that\"easy\" seems to be a recurring theme here?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would say that Apple has not done enough to promote the iLife applications.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Sure, the thought of these built in applications was appealing to me, and was a reason for purchasing the iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I didn't expect them to transform the way I used a computer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"These applications far exceeded my expectations, and if I was running Apple I would make even more of an effort in promoting them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With my PC, even though it was capable of making movies and managing music, I had never actually done it due to the fact that it was too much of a bother to figure out.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With iMovie and iTunes, it was a joy to do both.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, iPhoto makes it much easier to manage and share your photos, which means that I feel confident my photos are where I want them, and easy to get to - versus lost in the midst of some folder somewhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition to the iLife suit of applications, some other applications the unit ships with are iCal, iChat, Address Book and Mail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Obviously the person who decided not to put an\"i\" in front of Mail and Address Book is no longer with the company!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"iCal is obviously a calendar application ( not a calculator, but the iMac does come with one of those too ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"iChat is an instant messaging application that works between Macs and also is compatible with AOL Instant Messenger.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iChat does not support cross-platform ( Mac to PC ) videoconferencing, so I have not used it yet.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As I mentioned earlier, I am using the Yahoo Messenger for this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Address Book and Mail are just what they sound like.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are both very basic applications, but they do have one advantage.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That is, they integrate well with other Apple software.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are used to Outlook, you will NOT like Address Book, Mail and iCal, as they are all SEPARATE applications.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"No idea why Apple decided on this.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's actually not quite as bad as it sounds, as the applications do offer some integration/interaction with one another.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For example, if you are in Mail, you can click an e-mail and select\"add this person to your address book\", and it will add that contact to Address Book ( without having to open the Address Book application ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Still, if you are an Outlook fan, then Microsoft Office X comes with Entourage X, which is a Mac version of Outlook.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I loaded Entourage X to try it out, and I liked it very much.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I eventually stopped using it in favor of the Apple applications.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not because I thought they were better, but rather because iCal, Address Book and Mail seemed to integrate better with the other Apple applications.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For example, when I wanted to e-mail photos from iPhoto, iPhoto does offer you the option of selecting Apple Mail or Microsoft Entourage as the default mailer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, when I tried to have iPhoto send photos through Entourage, I got an error message.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I switched it to Apple Mail, and it worked flawlessly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That was enough to sell me on the idea of sticking with the Apple Applications.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hopefully they will improve them over time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have the luxury of managing my calendar and the majority of my contacts on my work machine, which is a PC running Outlook.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So my iMac is primarily used for e-mail and managing some personal contacts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I managed my business contacts on the iMac, I would definitely toss iCal, Address Book and Mail in favor of Entourage.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"INTERNET AND THE.MAC SERVICE","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't find much of a difference between the PC and Mac from a web-surfing standpoint.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One thing I guess I did notice was that Internet Explorer offered slower performance than it does on the PC platform.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The iMac does come with its own browser called Safari.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Safari does offer faster performance, and seemed much more responsive than Internet Explorer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This makes a lot of sense since IE was built for the PC and Safari was built for the Mac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After using both, I actually preferred Safari, primarily because it offered tabbed browsing - which I had never experienced before.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"To explain, when you open a link in Internet Explorer, it will override the existing page, causing you to have to hit the\"back\" button to get back where you were.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"IE also offers the ability to open the link in a new window, which means you don't override the page you were on previously, but now you have two windows open.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Tabbed browsing simply allows you to open a link on another tab, within the same window.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you click a link in Safari, it will override the existing page just like IE.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, if you hold the apple button on the keyboard down when you click a link, it will add a tab at the top of the browser and open the new page associated with the new tab.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can then click on the different tabs on the top of the browser window to switch between the pages, as well as click on the\" x\" on the tab itself to close the tab.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can have many tabs open at once, and switching between them is very simple since each tab is labeled with the title of the particular page it is associated with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Personally, I like the concept of tabbed browsing, which is why I preferred Safari.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also like the performance of Safari over IE.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another hidden gem I found on the Mac post-purchase was the.Mac service from Apple.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At $ 99 a year, it certainly isn't the cheapest hosting/e-mail service around.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, it is much more than that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a novice who wants to put up a web page, and I mean a TRUE NOVICE, there is no better solution.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The.Mac service has pre-formatted web page templates for just about everything, including templates for a homepage, file-sharing, photo albums, movies, writing, resume, baby, education and invitations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Furthermore, it doesn't allow the user anywhere near any programming code where they can screw anything up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, areas where text can be added only allow the user to put in their own text and move on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I believe you can make minor changes, such as text color and size, but that's it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Experienced web designers will find the.Mac templates to be far too simple and inflexible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, novices will get a big grin on how easy it is and how they can't mess things up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Especially when within 5 minutes ( no lie ) they will have a web page up with photos!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Speaking of photos, the.Mac service seamlessly works with iPhoto in what has to be one of the greatest feats of integration I have ever seen on a personal computer...and it works!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let's say you have taken pictures with your digital camera and imported them into iPhoto.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now you want to put some of those pictures on the website you created through the.Mac service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All you need to do is launch iPhoto and select the photos ( by clicking on them ) you want to put on your website.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once you select them, you simply click on the\"homepage\" icon on the bottom of iPhoto window.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This brings up a window which shows what your web page, complete with the photos, will look like.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also adds a title of the page, which you can overwrite, as well as an area where you can write a description of the event related to the photos on the page.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After you write whatever you want, you click on a\" theme\" from a number of designs that the.Mac service offers, which are various designs of borders that go around the photo ( such as wood frames, frameless, push pin, etc. ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once you select the theme, you hit\"publish\", and THAT IS IT!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only does it automatically publish the page, but it also adds a link to that photo page on your home page!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can then go back to your homepage in.Mac and edit the text for that link.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Down the road when you want to delete the photo page, you simply login to.Mac and it shows you a list of the pages on your site.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Select the one you want to delete and it not only deletes it, but also gets rid of the link to that page on your homepage.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In other words, you don't need to worry about the impact that changing or eliminating one page has on another page.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, you don't need to know the first thing about designing a website.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iPhoto combined with the.Mac service makes it easy for ANYONE to put up their own website.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can't stress enough how easy it is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, it gives you the option of password-protecting the site, which is a nice feature in this day and age.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For instance, I have lots of pictures of my house and family that I wouldn't necessarily want just anyone to see - which is why I did password protect my site.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The.Mac service also offers integration with iMovie for posting movie clips to your site, although I have not investigated that yet.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In addition, you get all sorts of free software and special offers ( that are actually worthwhile ) through.Mac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The.Mac service also offers all sorts of online training for many applications, such as the iLife applications.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other\" services\" it offers are e-mail, server space for backup, as well as an interesting way to backup and allow you to access your bookmarks, calendar, contacts and files over the internet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The.Mac files and folders are available to you on your iMac through a disk called the iDisk ( Apple really loves the letter\"i\", especially in lower case )!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The iDisk looks like just another disk on your iMac, but it is actually a virtual disk that is located at Apple on their servers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is where your website and backup files are located.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iSync automatically synchronizes information such as your calendar, contacts, bookmarks and files between your hard drive and your iDisk and makes them available to you over the internet through any web browser on any computer (PC or Mac ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iSync also performs various synchronization feats between your iMac and other Macs, as well as with Palm PDA's and bluetooth mobile phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once you get an understanding of how.Mac integrates with your iMac, and all the services it offers, $ 99 seems like a relative bargain.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am very glad I have the.Mac service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I should also note that more experienced website designers can upload their designs to the.Mac web server if they feel the.Mac templates are too simplistic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"WARRANTY","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apple warranties the iMac for one year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"SUPPORT","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apple provides complimentary phone support for 90 days from the date of purchase.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since I was new to the Mac world, I purchased 3 years of support for $ 169 ( called the AppleCare Protection Plan ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My assumption was that since I was new to the platform, I'd need the support more than the average person.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, I haven't called yet!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm almost hoping I will have a minor issue just to get some sort of payback on my investment!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually, the AppleCare Protection Plan also increases the warranty of your hardware an extra 2 years, to make it supported fully for 3 years on both the hardware and phone support.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also includes onsite service versus having to send it - or drive it - back to an Apple authorized service center ( which is the case with the standard 1 year warranty ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"COST","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't understand why many people say Apple's are more expensive than PC's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I was shopping, I found that the PC's from Dell and Gateway were MORE expensive for a similarly equipped computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I paid $ 1799 for my 17\" 1Ghz iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, at the writing of this review ( 10/23/03 ), I went to the Dell website to try and price out a PC which was as close to the specs of the 17\" iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here are the details of the Dell system, which was based on a 2.6 GHz Dimension 4600C, which is their ultra-compact desktop ( which most closely matches the footprint of the iMac ):","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dell Dimension 4600C","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pentium  4 Processor at 2.60GHz

needed a new computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( Note that we already have a perfectly good blue and white G3 and an iMac DV+. ) It's a testament to his devotion to me that didn't question ( too much ) my insistence on a new computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The big struggle for me was to decide which computer to buy.","target":"Genuine

course I considered another iMac ( my husband was lobbying heavily for this ) but I just felt like I wanted more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and then I saw it, the brand new, ultra sleek Flat Panel G4 iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was lust at first sight.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I told others that I had ordered a flat panel iMac, I got a mix of reactions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some were understandably envious and jealous.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, a small minority looked at me like

Previous Version?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In comparing the two computers, I will be referring to the more recent iMac models, not the original fruit colored ones with the hockey puck mouse.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, be aware that even though I am an avid and devoted Mac fan, I'm not a techno-geek.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Therefore, my comparison of these iMacs will be limited to the features that I can sort of understand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't sue me if I leave something out - just leave me a comment about my omissions and/or errors ( preferably a kind and supportive comment ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although first glance suggests that the new iMac is vastly different than its predecessor, there are a few basic similarities:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ All in one package: The beauty and simplicity of having everything you need in one integrated unit was a major selling point for the first iMacs and it continues to be a significant advantage of the new generation of iMacs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Mouse and keyboard: Both of these input peripherals are identical on my two iMacs - the Apple Pro Optical mouse and the full size Apple Pro keyboard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both are significant improvements over the cheesy undersized mouse and keyboard that shipped with the original iMacs ( and my G3 ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually, there is one notable difference with this iMac  both the keyboard and the optical mouse are snowy white, just like the computer itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The white keys are an improvement over the black keys on my other iMac keyboard because theyre much easier to see in the dark.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Minimal Expandability: There are not many options for expanding either iMac model, though the need for expansion seems less of an issue with the feature-packed new iMac.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Both have one available slot for memory ( which Ive already filled on both computers ) and the option of installing an Airport card.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now for the differences - some striking and some more subtle:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Size and shape: As you can see from the photo, the new iMac is a unique-looking computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Personally, I think it's elegant but then I did buy it so I suppose I'm biased.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rather than looking like a large CRT monitor ( like the old iMac ), the new one looks like a soccer ball ( except closer in size to a basketball ) cut in half with a slender flat screen literally floating in space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The new iMac only has a 10.6 inch footprint so even with the two speakers, keyboard, and mouse, I have tons more room on my computer desk to clutter up with other gadgets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Monitor: Instead of the 15-inch CRT on the older iMac, the new iMac has a brilliant flat-panel 15-inch display which provides almost the same viewable area as most 17-inch CRT monitors, but with twice the sharpness, brightness, and contrast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The screen is bordered in white and then further edged with clear plastic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Therefore, there is ample space to grab a hold of the screen and move it without actually putting your fingers on the viewable screen itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Speakers: This high-end iMac also ships with two 9-watt round external Apple Pro Speakers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The earlier iMacs are all limited to internal speakers that provide a much more limited audio experience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Apple Pro Speakers look like softball-sized clear eyeballs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sound quality is impressive, but then I haven't cranked them up to listen to any music yet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Hard Drive: Though hard drive size is not a huge issue for many people, I really appreciate the 60GB Ultra ATA hard disk drive on the new iMac ( as opposed to 20GB on my older iMac ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"All it took was a little digital video-editing project to max out my old iMac's hard drive space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Processor: Instead of the 450-MHz G3 in my first iMac, the newer iMac comes with the 800-MHz PowerPC G4 with Velocity Engine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This allows it to process data in larger chunks ( 128-bit ), in comparison to the smaller chunks used in earlier processors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What this means is that the newer iMac can easily handle the data-intensive processing required by digital video, music, graphics applications and 3D games.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also comes with a NVIDIA GeForce2 MX graphics processor with 32MB of dedicated Double Data rate video memory that gives a major boost to 3D graphics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Removable Media Drive: My old iMac was considered cutting edge ( OK, well not really ), because it came with a DVD player.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Though the removable media drives that ship with the new iMacs differ from model to model, this one is the top of the line - the SuperDrive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The SuperDrive is a DVD burner as well as a DVD player and CD-RW.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The new iMacs drive is also a tray drive as opposed to the slot drive on my older iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It fits flush to the round computer base and is almost invisible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can open and close the drive with the media eject key ( far upper right on keyboard ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"According to Apple, the SuperDrive\"writes DVD-R discs at 2x speed, reads DVDs at 6x speed, writes CD-R discs at 8x speed, writes CD-RW discs at 4x speed, reads CDs at 24x speed.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't timed it yet so I'll have to take their word for it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ More USB ports: The new iMacs have one extra USB port than the earlier iMacs, making a total of 5 USB ports ( counting the two on the Apple Pro keyboard ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I appreciate the extra port, though I suspect I'll still need a hub at some point.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Operating System: My first iMac was one of the last machines that shipped without OS X.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The new one comes with two operating systems: OS X and OS 9.2","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Digital Hub Goodies and Other Software: Both iMacs came with good software packages but the new iMac has the newer iTunes2, iMovie2, iPhoto, and iDVD2.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other software shipped on the new iMac includes the latest QuickTime, AppleWorks 6, Mail, Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Quicken 2002 Deluxe, World Book Mac OS X Edition, Otto Matic, Mac OS X Chess, PCalc, Acrobat Reader and FAXstf 10.0 Preview.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have nt checked it all out, though I have had a blast with the World Book ( encyclopedia, dictionary, atlas, and more ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"~ ~ Other Features ( not necessarily unique to this iMac ): The G4 iMac comes with 256 RAM ( I added another 256 immediately ), a built-in 56K V.90 fax modem, built-in 10/100BASE-T Ethernet ( takes RJ-45 connector ), two 400-Mbps FireWire ports, built-in antennas and a card slot for an optional 11-Mbps AirPort Card.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Adding additional memory and an airport card is a simple process of unscrewing the base plate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I had my extra memory installed free from MacConnection so I didn't need to do this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can find out more technical details by checking out Apple's web site:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Enough of the Dry Details, Tell Us About the Intangible iMac Experience!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I must admit  I love the all white look.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its downright virginal!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dont let appearances fool you, though.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Besides looking gorgeous, sitting on my desk, this G4 iMac screams in terms of speed!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The flat screen is crystal clear and sharp with all pixels live and accounted for.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's going to be hard to switch back and forth between this and my older CRT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The screen moves effortlessly up and down, forward and back, while maintaining the same angle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was a bit apprehensive about the strength of the chrome arm but after handling it a bit I can see that s more than tough enough.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, you lift the computer by the arm when you want to move it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The video quality in this computer is first rate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ive watched several DVDs on this without any problem, though I have nt yet burned one.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is a distinct hum to the computer ( probably a cooling fan ), though it s still quieter than my older iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The tray drive itself is rather loud opening and closing so I guess it could disturb someone sleeping in the room ( a potential issue for me since the computer is in our bedroom ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of my biggest concerns in getting the new computer was dealing with OSX.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though Ive been quite curious about this new operating system, Ive also been understandably nervous in having it on my new computer since virtually all of my applications ( except the ones that came pre-installed ) are not OSX compatible.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Fortunately, it also ships with OS 9.2 so I assumed I would make that my default operating system  if I could figure out how.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some people I know are so paranoid about OSX that they uninstalled it completely.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fortunately, I not only discovered that it s quite simple to switch default operating systems, I also was delighted to learn that the\" classic\" environment ( OS 9 ) kicked in automatically whenever I tried to us one of my earlier applications.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For example, I installed my Microsoft Office 98 without switching operating systems and it works just fine  in fact Im typing in it right now.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It takes a few seconds for the classic environment to open but then everything seems to work perfectly ( so far ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ease of dealing with the operating system question has definitely added to the pleasure of using this new iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One thing that s taking awhile to get use to is the location of the power button.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its on the back of the computer on the left side.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You cant see it so you have to feel around for it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its actually not hard to reach since the computer itself is so petite but it sure confuses people who are unfamiliar with the G4 iMac (\" How do you turn this thing on?\" ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I still miss the power button on the keyboard ( on my Blue and White G3 ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Practical Considerations with the G4 iMac","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though I'm thrilled with my new purchase, I do have some doubts about the practicality of this model in certain situations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, I don't think this iMac will ever take off as a computer of choice in the public schools ( a haven for the original iMac ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The flat screen is just too delicate for the kind of handling that curious and impulsive kids provide.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, I have my concerns about my own kids and the flat screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Originally, I envisioned this computer serving as the\"family computer\" where I could write Epinions, my husband could surf the net, and our young children could play games.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For now, I've banned my kids from even coming within 5 feet of this baby, though I know I won't be able to enforce the\" no kid zone\" for long.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My six-year-old is already talking about what games he wants to load on to\" Mamas new computer.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dr_Steph's Recommendation","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 800MHz Flat Screen G4 iMac is everything I want in a computer - fast, reliable, powerful, compact, beautiful, and downright fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has the features to delight the experienced computer whiz, yet is simple enough for the novice to enjoy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In case you couldn't tell yet, I love my new computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can laugh all you want - I know you're just jealous.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Beginning...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apple snagged me as a prospective customer in January of 2001 after a series of problems with my Gateway desktop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was in the market for a laptop for school and decided to try the local Apple reseller in town.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The technicians were knowledgeable and friendly the the price was right.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I found that I could customize my own iBook through www.apple.com,","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and shipping was free.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The chance to avoid the pressure of salesmen was attractive and so I quickly placed my order.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A week later I received my new Keylime iBook and promptly fell in love it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A year later...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A year had passed and my Gateway desktop was still giving me the same problems it had been giving me since I had purchased it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I had learned to live with the problems as it had been a gift from my parents.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That was until I found out that Apple had released photos of it's upcoming Flat Panel iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I immediately fell in love all over again and experienced the urge to own one ASAP ( part of the compulsive shopper speaking out in me, part of me knew it would make my digital lifestyle a heckuva lot easier ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I once again placed a customized order through www.apple.com","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"for the top of the line model: 800 MHZ G4 Superdrive with DVD/CD RW capabilities, 60 GB of memory, and I bumped the RAM from 256 to 512 MB.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some may argue that the DVD-RW may not be necessary, but I wanted to keep my options open just in case I purchase a digital camcorder in the future.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ground shipping, as always, was free.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All together my purchase came close to $ 1900.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You could also choose from a 700 mhz model that had a CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive ( as opposed to the DVD-RW drive with the 800 mhz ), or an even cheaper 700 mhz model that had just a CD-RW drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They were around $ 1600 and $ 1400 respectively.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( **NOTE: Prices since have gone up about $ 100 a computer since my purchase due to rising costs of quality parts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Worth it in my opinion. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was able to finance the computer through MBNA, which provides an easy loan application through the Apple website.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I placed the order in the middle of January with the promise of it being delivered in 3-5 weeks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I settled in for the long wait.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Verdict...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Five weeks to the day later, I received an e-mail from Apple stating that it would be delayed an additional 7 days.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At this point, I was so used to waiting that the message didn't phase me.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, I was surprised when I received an e-mail two days later saying it had been shipped.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Five days later and it was on my doorstep.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First off, Apple knows how to deliver.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was in a perfectly square box that had a picture of the iMac on one side, and an Apple logo on the other.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I cut through the top of the box and was greeted by a heavy-weight poster of the new iMac in various positions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Do I dare say it looked like it was dancing?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At this point I couldn't wait.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I removed the poster and styrofoam that contained the keyboard, and the styrofoam that surrounded the computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Set-up was a snap.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I lifted the computer out making sure to grip the\"arm\" with one hand and the base with the other and placed it onto the table.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I connected one end of the plug into the computer and the other into the wall.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then, I connected the keyboard and speakers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Finally, I connected the mouse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was frustrated at the amount of USB slots that were taken up until I realized that the mouse is meant to be plugged into the keyboard ( which contains two USB slots at the top ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Whoops.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nevermind being frustrated, I was now impressed!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apple supplied their customers with a total of five USB slots on this beauty, along with two firewire slots.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"More than enough.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I fired up my new beauty by pushing the\"power button\" located on the left side of the base and was greeted by OS X.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It looked absolutely amazing on the 15 inch LCD monitor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"OS X was automatically programmed to get me setup as a new user and onto the internet in the fastest way possible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I already had a user account through Earthlink and I had no problems setting it up, but Apple also gave the option to set up a new account.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ten minutes later I was surfing the internet with my new iMac.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apple also supplies their users with accounts for iTools.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This account gives you access to an e-mail address ( mine is xxskagirlxx@mac.com )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and additional access to community features online.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was able to immediately access my\"mac mail\" through the mail program in OS X ( when connected to the internet ) but I also wanted to access my Earthlink mail account.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Setting up the mail program to retrieve my Earthlink mail was a piece of cake!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All I needed to do was fill out my domain, username and password.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can now retrieve both mail accounts from my Apple.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After a bit I decided to install a game.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once again, installation was flawless and the game ( The Sims, a memory hog ) ran great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The computer also came with iTunes, iMovie and iDVD.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I tried iTunes out right away and was impressed the the simplicity of the program.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The music that was preloaded into the program sounded wonderful through the Apple Pro Speakers that came with the system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm looking forward to starting a new MP3 collection.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm also looking forward to using iMovie and iDVD in conjunction with a digital camcorder, when I get around to purchasing one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I need to win the lottery first.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've also gotten a lot of use out of iPhoto, Apple's digital photo editing software.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I own an Olympus digital camera and I love to download my photos to edit them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I've always had such a tough time keeping track of the photos once they were saved to my computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iPhoto eliminatated this problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The program saves each set of pictures you download as a\"roll\" of film to be accessed later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pictures can be left in the\"rolls\" or I can reorganize them as I wish.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can also organize the photos into slide shows with one click of a button.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's very simple to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apple has a reputation for being different and making software that is easy for the average consumer to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They easily live up to their name with this computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only is the G4 Superdrive ultra fast (arguably faster than my Gateway Athlon ), it's quieter than a mouse.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Surprisingly, the base doesn't get hot as one would think, meaning Apple has done a superb job of designing the CPU.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The screen, of course, is a genius idea.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can pull it closer when I want to read a website.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could push it back when I want to play a game.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All it takes is a little push with one finger and it hovers to where I want it to go.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can also push it up or down if my neck is getting strained.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lack of space the computer takes up is definately a plus as it isn't intimidating as other, bulkier computers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And, the software is a snap to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't had any freeze-ups or hardware problem

impress.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is probably too much computer for those who do not have business needs, but you never know when you will need the capabilities that the Sony VAIO PCG-FRV27 Notebook provides.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Without a doubt, a very good new laptop from Sony.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I purchased and am quite satisfied with the IBM ThinkPad G40 PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are many models, differing in the clock speed of the Intel chip, the size of the hard disk, whether there is a wireless card built, in, etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My comments relate to the whole family of G40 ThinkPads.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Prior to purchasing the G40, I was also interested in, and tried out, several Sony Vaio and Dell notebooks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Sony had a sharper, glossy display and is much lighter ( the G40 is rather heavy ), but the typing keys were too close together and shallow, and the Vaio can only be booted with the latest Microsoft system (XP ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In contrast, the G40 can be booted with 98SE, 2000, and both versions of XP.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was important to me because I purchased several PCs with Windows ME, a defective, unstable system, and only after purchasing them found that the machines could not be formatted for W98 because the chips in the machine expected the ME junk.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Despite what many people claim, PCs are not a commodity, in that the feel of the keyboard and the resolution of the screen differ from company to company and model to model.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was attracted to Dell because it offered customization over the Internet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could select what I want ( more memory, better screen ) and dump what I did not want ( overpriced high-end Intel chips, Humvee-sized hard disks ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And I would not have to spend hours on the'phone, during inconvenient times, with an idiot specifying each part, I could just enter it via the Internet.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But if you want to actually touch a Dell, in most of the world, forget it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I called Dell from a Chicago location and asked where I could see a demo model, and was told that the nearest location was Florida.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since the operator was in an Indian call center, he mentioned the Floridia location as if it were the next street down from me, because he had no idea of North American geography.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I began to wonder what would happen if I had a technical question and had to talk to someone in India.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I finally managed to play with several Inspirons in Tokyo, but was disappointed by their cheap, creaky plastic parts and the keyboard with substandard key spacing and key travel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Too bad, otherwise the Inspiron 8600 is a nice machine, but I type lots of reports and articles, and I need a machine with a superb keyboard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't have space to add a separate keyboard on my desk.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Here is where the G40 shines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has a wonderful keyboard at an ergonomic angle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I use my PC mainly for reports, comments, spreadsheets,etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't use it for games ( that's what a PlayStation-Game Cube-Xbox are for ) and I don't use it to read email while I travel ( that's what a PDA is for ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The G40 accepts a PS/2 plug for keyboards, although the built-in keyboard is excellent by itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The PS/2 jack is being phased out of notebooks, like the serial port, but there aren't that many USB keyboards available and who wants to use up all their USB ports with basic equipment?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Besides the keyboard, I was attracted to IBM's responsible service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"IBM has always had well-trained, courteous help staff, and has repaired or replaced problems immediately in past IBMs I have owned.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sometimes, the repairs were free.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other times, they were not as expensive as elsewhere.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If one ignores the keyboard and the service, the G40 is a plain vanilla PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is only 2.4GHz, it only ships with 256MB memory (upgrades to 1GB), this model has a 40GB hard disk but that only spins at 4200 rpm instead of the newer 7200 rpm, the memory cache is on the processor and not separate, etc.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Since memory and drives are commodities available cheaply, one wonders why IBM doesn't splurge a bit and include the latest stuff, but IBM was never the low-cost leader.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The G40 model I purchased ( 2388-4XJ) comes with 4 USB 2.0 ports.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other PCs have only 2, and trust me, they will be full from the first week of use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also comes with CD RW/DVD, 1 PC card slot, parallel, monitor ports, built-in floppy drive, built-in T100 ethernet, audio jacks and a modem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did not want a built-in wireless card, they typically are incompatible with third-party transmitters.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Dell Inspiron 5150 is a powerful notebook with some nice components to give you plenty of power and needs on the go!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The power of this notebook is run by the 3.06GHz mobile Intel Pentium 4 processor with 333MHz of DDR memory and the ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 graphics chip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Inspiron 5150 is upgradeable with several options, this one that I am reviewing has 512MB of 333MHz DDR RAM, and 64MB of 266MHz RAM for the ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 graphics chip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other features include a 15\" Ultra Sharp UXGA Display, a 60GB Ultra ATA Hard Drive and a 2x CD/DVD burner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( DVD+RW/+R ) Added upgrades for Microsoft Windows XP Professional and Microsoft Works Suite 2003.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We added a leather case which brought the cost to $ 2377 before tax with a 1 Year Limited Warranty plus 1 Year At-Home Service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Dell Inspiron 5150 starts as low as $ 1499.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Memory","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One disappointment in upgrading the Inspiron 5150 was the memory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 5150 comes with two slots and the 512 MB of memory for one slot was $ 150 higher in price, so we settled on two 256MB chips.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here is one of those deals that Dell continues to rip off the consumer because the price of two 256MB chips and the one 512MB chip should be about $ 20 difference in cost.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The good part is they are using PC 2700 333MHz DDR memory for a faster performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Processor","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Dell Inspiron 5150 is available with only one processor, the 3.06GHz mobile Intel Pentium 4 processor with on-die 512K L2 cache and 533 MHz Front Side Bus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is plenty of processor for anything that you may need for now.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Display","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Inspiron 5150 comes standard with a 15\" SXGA display and an upgrade to a 15 UltraSharp UXGA TFT high-resolution display.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The upgrade to the 15\" Ultra Sharp UXGA Display was a good investment because the display is crystal clear with brilliant colors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Graphics","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The choice to go with the ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 graphics was a great idea.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It comes standard with 32MB of DDR RAM running at 266MHz.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is an AGP 4x graphics card and can be ordered with the 64MB installed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I highly recommend the 64MB over the 32MB.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other Features","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"FireWire","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"S-Video-out,","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"VGA, Ethernet","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Two USB 2.0 ports","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A 56Kbps-modem V.92","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One Type II PC Card slot","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A jack for headphones and a jack for a microphone","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Looks","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Dell Inspiron 5150 comes in a new Moonlight Silver and Venice blue that makes it look very attractive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Looking at and around the notebook in the Front and Top you have the 15 inch screen, keyboard, mouse pad and a pair of front mounted speakers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The left side has a PCMCIA Type I/I I card Slot, Microphone/headphone jacks and a Media bay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The right side has the 56K modem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rear has an AC adapter plug-in, S-video out, Two USB ports, Monitor out, IEEE 1304 port and 10/100 Ethernet port.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bottom has an access door for the memory, the hard drive and battery compartment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dell did nt include a serial or PS/2 port; these are ports that are outdated today.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"No big loss on these ports I think you will see them disappear from most systems yet to come.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Good choice Dell!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall the performance is fast; playing DVD movies are no problem at all with a clear and smooth running movie.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Games are fast and produce beautiful graphics with no hesitation at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Color is beautiful on anything that you do with the Inspiron 5150; the games are the most impressive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sound through the speakers are fair, they are missing a good bass sound.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Adding a nice set of speakers for use at home would be helpful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The built-in mouse is easy to use, not as good as a regular cordless mouse but for trips it will do fine.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"At home I still prefer a USB cordless Optical mouse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was very impressed with the battery use; I get roughly 4 hours of usage before I need to recharge it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"An extra battery here could get you around 8 hours of usage, this maybe something to consider if you are on the go a lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am very impressed with the quality that went into this notebook, in my book the Dell Inspiron 5150 is one of their best computers on the market today!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 5150 has proved to be a true desktop replacement...with all the pros and cons that go along with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My Model","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"3.06GHz Pentium 4","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"UXGA screen","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"XP Home","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"512 Meg RAM on 2 DIMMs","target":"Genuine

negative"},{"sentence":"NVIDIA GeForce FX Go5200 64Mb","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am delighted with this machine's performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The machine is extremely fast when running at full-speed, and multi-tasks well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When running at battery-conservation speeds, the machine is still very responsive, though I do notice occasional sluggishness while trying to listen to MP3's and process large files in Photoshop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The screen is fantastic!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is well suited for the demands of photo editing; vastly superior than my previous laptop ( IBM T22 ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The color range is noticeably better -- pure whites and deep blacks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The screen is also noticeably brighter than my IBM T22, and reasonably usable in outdoor shade.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would estimate that the screen is still readable at about 130-degrees, though the brightness falls-off outside of 90-degrees.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am still working to adjust to the massive 1600x1200 native resolution.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some websites just aren't intended for such a large resolution.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The screen is still very usable at lower resolutions, despite some diminished quality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So far, the system has had no problems sleeping or hibernating.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The options are very configurable -- hard-drive, processor, screen, network, etc -- based on inactivity, or closing the screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have un-installed most of the Dell software.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All software un-installed flawlessly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I left the Dell Support Alerts, but it has proved worthless and will soon be removed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's just a shot-gun approach to curbing customer service contacts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am constantly being reminded of Windows updates I've already downloaded, and tips on how to burn CD's using Roxio -- things I don't need alerts for.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've set it for critical alerts only, but still receive the Roxio messages every couple of days.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After reading feedback from others, I was concerned that my 4200rpm hard-drive might be too slow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It hasn't been an issue for me, even though I listen to mp3's and work with large Photoshop files at the same time.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was pleasantly surprised by the battery life!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can easily get 2 hours, and up to 3.5 if I'm conservative.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For two hours, all I do is lower the CPU speed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can still use the screen at full brightness and listen to mp3's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The touchpad takes some getting used to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I miss the trackpoint on my IBM Thinkpad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But the touchpoint is very configurable, and includes some thoughtful capabilities.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can tap on it to double-click, and you can configure it to continue scrolling the mouse when you reach the edge of the pad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even with the sensitivity set to high, it still takes more muscle work than either the trackpoint or a regular mouse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The DVD Burner works flawlessly, and it is much faster than my old 16x CD burner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ability to burn 4.7Gig of digital photos onto a single disk is VERY nice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since the drive fits under the palm rest, you can feel a little bit of heat while you're burning disks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's not hot enough to cause discomfort, but you are reminded why they call it\"burning.\"","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The integrated wireless card was a smart way to go.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Works even better than my PCMCIA card, and there is no protruding antennae.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The overall build construction isn't as solid as my IBM Thinkpad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This machine is more\"plasticy.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When picking it up with one hand, you can feel the case flex a bit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But given this machine's weight, I won't be holding it with one hand for prolonged periods, anyway.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Very quiet -- compared to my desktop PC.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Minor gripes...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wish the headphone jack didn't get in the way of the cd tray.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also wish the PCMCIA card adapter was easier to eject.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The included DVD viewing software is clunky, but it works.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Like all laptops, I find some of the key locations awkward.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The eject button on the CD tray has a little too much\"play\" in it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The keys are a little flimsy, and I suspect I will catch one of them with the edge of my finger and break it, eventually.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But that also happened on my Thinkpad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't like the sliver/blue design -- what was wrong with grey and black?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am extremely happy with my purchase.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Canceled my order for an Inspiron 8500 for the 5150 - and have no regrets.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This sweet notebook has everything I was looking for: performance, value, quality construction, and CAE capability.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything worked flawlessly out of the box - except for strange behavior of the second USB port.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Updated drivers downloaded from the Dell support site later cleared that problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I took advantage of the free 512 MB upgrade offer, and added the 60 GB HDD.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 4200 RPM speed is a bit behind the curve, but use of a larger disk cache (XP or 3rd party ) can compensate for this somewhat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As another reviewer observed, Dell's expansion options are occasionally overpriced.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Compare, pick, and choose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A trip to local computer store ( Fry's ) yielded lower-cost port expander, 12-volt adapter, floppy drive, and USB networking cable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"PC2700 notebook RAM is available much cheaper over the WWW, when upgrade time comes around.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just order what Dell offers'free'.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also ordered an extra battery pack from Dell.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Haven't needed it yet, since a 3-hour DVD movie leaves 40 % capacity to spare on a single battery.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The tilde key is in an awkward place; otherwise the keyboard is fine, and does not have the problems reported for the Inspiron 8500.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Built-in sound quality is poor: headphones or external speakers work fine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I miss the printer and serial ports, since I didn't want to replace my legacy home office equipment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The USB port expander fixed that, and works well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With that and an external USB 2.0 HDD enclosure for my old 80 GB drive ( now used for backups ), I was able to retire the old desktop: the 5150 is my'main' machine on the road AND at home, with NO sacrifices.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"These omissions are VERY minor: this is a beautiful, first-rate desktop replacement for gaming or serious engineering work.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The basics are rock solid: processor, chipset, FSB/memory speed, display, graphics acceleration, performance/battery life, quiet operation, runs cool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The just-released Inspiron 8600 may be a better choice for gaming or DVD viewing, but I believe the 5150 is a better fit for CPU-intensive business and engineering use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why no reviews on this model?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Because most folks are not familiar with the name Sharp as far as computers go.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is a brand exclusive to Circuit City so I don't think most folks feel comfortable with it yet.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They should give it a try.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a lot to love about the Sharp Actius RD10.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has so many features that other laptops do not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Number one on my list is:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"NO Shared memory!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That's right, most laptops have about a half a gig of SDRAM, but they share that with the video.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now, in the majority of cases this won't be an issue.. but if you plan to play any of todays graphic-intense games, you need it to not be shared.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That was what swung us to buy this model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We can't be having our memory smashed in the middle of battle.. know what I'm sayin?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"heh.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No problemo with this baby!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Number two would be the display: Amazingly crisp, bright, and clear display.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Brighter even than any of our CRTs!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On our desk tops we're running a Sony Multiscan 400PS on mine, and a Samsung Syncmaster 1200NF.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This laptop monitor blows them both away on clarity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm not talking hmm I think that is a little brighter.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm talking Oh hell look at the difference in this puppy!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's also surprising to me that there is no difference in this between battery or if it's plugged in.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Just a freakin sweet display!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sound is also, of course, built in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are two speakers up near the display and while they won't rival your desk top speakers, they do the job.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You won't want to be cranking your music CDs on this, but for watching a DVD or cruising the web they are more than adequate.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Have a digital camera?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plug your memory card right in to the front side!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's right, no need for extra gadgets, this sucker I believe has a slot for about any size camera flash card.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It fits my Cannon and has other slots for other sizes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Very convenient indeed...and it's fast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually, the pictures come up faster on this than on my big Micron Millennia.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The wireless ( 802.11B ) is built in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Again, no need to keep track of endless accessories for everything, it's all right here built in.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The wireless works seemlessly on this baby too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could tell no difference between cruising the web on this with the wirelss and my PC which is cabled to the hub.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It worked when we took it upstairs too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That may speak to the effectiveness of our wireless thingy in general, but I tend to think it's a combo of that and the wireless set up in the Sharp itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the geeky stuff:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2.8-GHz Pentium 4, 512MB of DDR SDRAM, Windows XP Home, 15-inch XGA screen, NVidia GeForce4 420 Go with 32MB of DDR SDRAM, 60GB hard drive, 8X DVD-ROM and 24X/10X/24X CD-RW combo drive, built-in V.90 modem, 10/100 ethernet port, touchpad pointing device, One-year parts and labor warranty; lifetime 24-hour daily toll-free technical support.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Battery life is not something I am concerned about, but this one is only about an hour and a half.. probably due to the awesome display.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In the car I can plug into the cigarette lighter though, and the hotel of course has jacks, airlines also have plug-ins if you have the adapter..","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can't think of very often that I would need more than that hour and a half of battery life anyway, and if you're smart you always keep a spare battery anyway.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So, to me at least, that isn't even an issue.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I figured some of you may like to know though.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has no serial or parallel printer ports, but it does have 4 USB 2.0 ports.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"( I have no idea what I just said, Nick told me to add this part )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Why am I replacing this if I like it so much?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because it's very heavy at 10.3 pounds ( 12.2 with the adapter and all that stuff ) and over 2 inches thick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yep.. sad to say, but it's like lugging bricks around.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, I'm having a difficult time finding a bag that it will fit in even.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is one behemoth mo'fo, I'm tellin ya!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So...the thing is I do recommend this machine, just not for folks who travel a lot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This would be very good as a desk top replacement for a college student in a dorm, or as an additional home unit in another room or something.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For compact travel though?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No way.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I think we're going to go buy a little Sony today for our trip to New York next week.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As much as I love the features on this Sharp, I just am not lugging the damn thing around!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I don't usually write in electronics, so you folks need to tell me if I left anything out here.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I do plan to review whatever we decide to buy tonight also, so please do give me a heads up if there is any vital info you want in addition to what I have put here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thanks guys!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bought this computer almost 4 months ago.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still works: ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But let's review it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First what I liked about this model is that it is really everything in one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It contains all(still, computer world so fast changing, that almost everyday there is more invented, so correct me if I will be wrong ) possible media readers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well someone can wonder why there is floppy disc reader?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i mean floppy is really old fashioned and probably will be gone sooner or later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But meanwhile, there is people who will use it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other readers include Sony Memory stick, SD card, Smart Media, Compact Flash, Pc Card slot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well can't forget to mention that there is 4 USB and one FireWire port.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also 60 GB hard drive... my god, this computer probably made for file storage...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I must tell that is computer isn't perfect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First - display.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is advertised as extreme brightness and wide vieving angles, at least sticker on computer say so.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well it is bright, but don't forget that it is ONLY XGA!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can compare this computer with other computers, with xga lcd.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is brighter, but comparing with sxga ( I am not talking about uxga)it is not so good.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I mean brightness is not all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"How about picture detail, crispness?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Besides, that brightness adjustment button is not necessary.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When you turn brightness off, the view on screen is dull.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well might be it save some battery life...

Must be was out of stock or something?.. Still i guess that other brands could charge more for the same stuff.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I bought it for more than 1700 $ (with a 100$ mail in rebate,and some other catches: ) ) but now it cost about 1300-1400.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"processor speed seems a champion when you look at the data sheet ( pentium 4, 2.8 ghz ), but when you use a laptop, it seems it is a little bit slower than it suppose to be.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Especially when you turn it on after it was turned off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I use a password to protect it, so it takes couple extra seconds, but when it is on, I can't use any programs, because it freeze for about 5 minutes.unless","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i leave a program running and close lid, so it shuts down, but it is faster to start it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actius rd10 is locked to microsoft windows xp home edition.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I guess it wouldn't be popular among computer pros, who want linux or even other windows... My opinion is that windows'95 is better than xp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I cannot mess up with OS... ussually when i play dvd and laptop run on batteries, dvd play with some interupptions.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is like running on pause step by step, frame by frame, and again at normal speed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Burned music on cds sounds metalish like music was performed with bad equipment, even using other cd players.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Upgrading lovers will be disappointed when they find out

all the time, and it is louder than some desktop's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ok I guess I said enough to prevent from buying this item.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But if I had an opportunity to choose a laptop again, I most likely would buy this one again.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At least for these all options - pentium 4( 2.8 ghz ), bunch of media readers, spacy hard drive, cd-rw/dvd drive, NOT shared video memory, I can play games perfectly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It has wireless 802.11b, even I don't use at all, but it is nice to have: ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Laptop don't have printer port, so you will either use a cord-adaptor or one of 4 usb ports.","target":"Genuine

data sheets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seems that even after 4 months this computer is more advanced than others, and price is attractive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"HP has come out with their own 17 inch widescreen notebook labeled the zd7000 which is the customizabe version of the zd70XX series.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"so if you see other notebooks with zd70XX, everything would apply except for certain things like the processor speed, amount of ram and video ram, size of the harddrive, and if the wireless option is installed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and now that you know the difference, lets get on with the review.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"my specs are:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"3.2 ghz processor","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"512 MB ram","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"128 mb nvidia geforce

actually opted in for the wireless, but when i had ordered my machine, i was under the impression that the wireless card was just a pcmci card which i already had, this was because on the HP website, they showed a pcmci card next to the laptop, but then later updated the image to show a mini pci card which is correct.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"this would work better since embedded behind the laptop screen, there are antennaes which greatly increase the effectiveness of the wireless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"but i was mislead and now i suffer for it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and dont think that you can use another mini pci card because there have been other people that have had problems doing this because the bios checks for a particular brand of mini pci card, adn they have not been able to change the bios or anything to make it work.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"so might as well be safe and get it preinstalled.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"other than that, I am extremely happy with this laptop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"its not quite as nice as my apple g4 17 but then what is?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"so here's the run down:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"screen","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the screeen is HUGE! 17 inches with a resolution of 1440x900.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"thats really impressive, i definitely have more work space, and the colors are crisp, although it will seem a bit dull under flourescent lighting, but this is due to them not installing a protective shield like the toshiba p25-s607 which also uses this screen, but seems crisper.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"but their screens dont look great outdoors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"so its a trade off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the screen is bright and beautiful, especially when watching dvds. it just blows my mind how great it looks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"one thing that would seem weird is that the screen is narrower than what you may be used to with other laptops or monitors, but this is a wide screen, and therefore you get more sideways real estate but also lose the top-to-bottom real estate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"all in all, the screen is fantastic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have been able to work with 2 full windows of word or excel ( that doesnt mean maximized ) and its just great expecially when editing documents.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"keyboard and touchpad","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the keyboard is also cool because it features the numeric keypad which i havent seen on other laptops.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"but don;t let that alone be the reason to buy this. the keys are a bit stiff and springy which is great for the tactile typers, but if you have carpal tunnel, like i do, it does tend to aggravate it somewhat, which is why i use an external keyboard that has softer keys.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the keyboard is a full size keyboard, which is great with no real odd key placements like some laptop vendors do.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"you also get a full size backspace key too which comes in handy a lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"as for the touchpad, one annoying design issue is that they decided to make the touchpad wide, so when i do type through the keyboard and i tend to rest my palms on the laptop, my hands tend to somehow glide onto the touchpad which puts the cursor somewhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"this movement is annoyingh especially when editing documents because i would accidentally move the cursor somewhere so that when i do look at the screen to see what else i would need, i would find the text in odd places.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is definitely annoying, but I havent heard of any other complaints.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"even decreasing the sensitivity doesnt completely fix the solution.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"also, near the top of the touchpad, it does tend to get a bit warn.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"all in all the touchpad is responsive and sometimes the cursors can jump around when using it, so I would recommend using an external mouse, like the logitech mx700.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"sound","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the speakers on this laptop are harmon kardon speakers, and they are fanastic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i haven't heard sound this great on a laptop ever.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i had a bunch of mp3 from my last computer that I played on this laptop and at first, I thought the speakers weren't any good because of the tinny sound, but then I realized that it was because of the bit rate encoding, it was encoded at 96 bits instead of 128 or 196 for cd quality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"once i popped in a cd, the sounds came alive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was pleasantly surprised by this, and it does get loud, unlike some laptops where even if you put the sound at the highest setting, you still can barely hear it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not with these speakers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I actually only have the volume at 2 or 3 bars because its so loud.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One this missing though is a subwoofer, but thats a small price to pay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"battery life...battery life...battery life...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"it wont last longer than 2 hrs, but you can do some power saving things such as reduce the brightness of the screen, dont use the dvd drive, etc, but then whats the fun? this is definitely meant as a desktop replacement.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"for you just want to take it with you, but only if there is a deskt and an outlet available.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"otherwise you should purchase extra batteries or one of those solar panels that can power it up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"along the lines of battery power, is the actual power converter or brick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"man, this thing is heavy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"its slightly larger than other converters too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and its also a 3 prong plug going into the brick, so if you plan on using a mini power surge protector, belkin has a nice one, i dont think targus makes one, or at least they didnt have one at best buy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"over all impressions","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"my overall impression of the laptop is two thumbs up. the blue lighting is very mesmerizing, and the dvd drive is very responsive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i havent tried burning a dvd yet, i have to find some tiem to buy dvd r blanks, i wish it were a multi drive, but can't have everything.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"also, the dvd drive is a 4x drive, the included roxio software lists it as a 2.4x but when I installed nero 6, it read it as a 4x drive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the media slots are also a plus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"they let you use your smart digital, memory stick, and 3 others which i dont know off hand, but those are the ones i use, and it works great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"no more carrying around the adapter for these.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"the case definitely seems sturdy, there is no flex in the keyboard, at least none that i can tell ( i dont want to break this ) and also this laptop is heavy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"its about 10 pounds with the battery and the adapter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"there are 4 usb 2.0 connections and a firewire conenction, the small one, parallel port and vga out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"there is also s-video out which i havent tried, but will do soon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"downsides","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"some of the design problems i have with this are that the ac plug goes into the back left of the laptop instead of at the back.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"this is ok, but annoying.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the placement of the volume buttons being on the top of the keybaord, near the quick launch buttons, who thought of this? i guess ive been spoiled with volume buttons being on the sides.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the only firewire connection is on the left side which is also weird, b/c I tend to just leave my firewire external hdd plugged in, so i usually have this plug protruding from the left side.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"thats somewhat annyoing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the size of the beast also makes it difficult to purchase bags.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"since it just hit the market, most bags that are able to carry it are bulky and ugly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and the ones that fit the G4 wont fit this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"which blows because now i have to find another bag.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i was hoping the timbuk2 bag which just came out for the g4 would fit, but to no avail.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"it was made to tightly fit the apple.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"another thing is when typing with this on yer laptop, which i dont recommend since you will be covering the fan inlets, the positioning the keybaord will make it weird to type.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"that definitely takes some getting used to, and the heat makes it not feel so good.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"it doesnt get as hot as the apple, but it gets uncomfortably warm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"one other thing is that this laptop doesnt have themedia controls that many other laptops have, that allow you to play your cds without turning on the computer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"conclusion","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"this machine is great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"its definitely an investment to be happy with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i especially liked the fact that i could customize it to my liking, and when yer buying a laptop, especially a wintel machine, you want to think about the future and what you'll be able to do.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the HT or hyperthreading on this is great an all, but there arent that many applications that can take advantage of that just yet, other than some of those intensive graphics apps and database apps.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"but its cool to have!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"also the 128MB of video ram also allows me to play future games as well as todays latest.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i havent had a chance to load up some graphics heavy games, but from what i saw on my friends with only 64 mb on his toshiba p25, i am sure mine will blow his away!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have been looking to replace our aging laptop for a while.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I sat down and thought about how we have been using it and realized that we really didn't do much mobile computing; I mainly used it as a home base when we traveled.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Keeping this in mind steered me toward a desktop replacement type of laptop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As far as desktop replacements go this one is at the top of the pack.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bought the zd7040 which is the version available at Best Buy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most other computer stores have the zd7020, the only difference is that the 7040 has a 60Gig hard drive and the 7020 has an 80Gig.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Best Buy had a great 18 month no interest deal and the extended warranty was better.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The screen has to be seen to be believed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is 17 diagonally with a widescreen ratio.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This could substitute for your main TV in a pinch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The contrast is very good and the images are very sharp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The processor is a desktop Pentium 4 at 2.8GHz.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Different models may have faster/slower versions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think there is even one with the new hyper threading processor for bigger $ $.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This model has the GeForce to go FX 5600 chip with 64Megs of RAM.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I ran 3DMark2001 benchmarks and got over 10000!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My older desktop with a GeForce 4 4200 could nt get that high.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This thing really is a nice desktop crammed into a portable  package.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dont mislead yourself into thinking you will be working away on a long flight.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This thing probably wont even fit on an average tray table, it is that big.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It weighs about 10 pounds with the AC adapter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The battery life is also not that great.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I worked in our living room for a while and got about 45 minutes when the battery read 50 %, so I am guessing about 1  hours with normal use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think if you are playing some 3D games it will be less.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hey, at least you can play some 3D games.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This graphics chip supports Direct X9.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How many laptops can say that!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are ports-a-plenty: ( 4 ) USB 2.0, one firewire, one S-video out, one VGA, one parallel, headphones, mic, 10/100 Ethernet, modem, IR, 5 different digital media reader ( compact flash, SD, memory stick, etc. ), ( 2 ) Type I PCMCIA slot or ( 1 ) Type II slot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This actually has more ports than my desktop!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The keyboard is full sized and there is a numeric pad on the right ( the Toshiba model that also uses this screen does nt have the numeric pad and does nt look nearly as cool ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The touchpad is pretty good and the software lets you do some neat stuff.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One weird thing is that HP has the tap-click feature ( that everyone else uses ) disabled by default, but you can change it in the settings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This model has a DVD +R/RW drive but I have nt tried it out yet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It reads CD just fine and plays DVDs great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sound is by Harmon Kardon and is OK.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have Harmon Kardon in my car and I am not overly impressed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I think Bose would do a better job.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It still sounds way better than most tinny laptop speakers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the amount of room they had to work with though, I would think they could have done even better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One thing that is bothersome is the amount of power it consumes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I cant find an auto adapter to power it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It looks like it draws about 120 watts but the new Targus 120 watt auto adapter does nt say it supports it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe in a few months the situation will improve.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall I am very happy but this is the Hummer of laptops.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For what it was built to do it does very well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just don't think it will be something it isn't ( like light ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Bradman","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just barely received my new PowerMac G5.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's the 1.6 ghz model with a little more than standard RAM and hard drive space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's awesome...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The blazing speed of this computer is amazing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am on a budget for school, and so I did not get the 1.8 or the 2.0 ghz models.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But I can't see how anything could get faster.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only can I run everything and anything at once, but I can do it with such incredible stability that it would make any window's user cry.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I can literally go down to the dock ( containing 30+ items ), and click on every program there, and they will all start up fine without any crashing at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Find a PC that can do that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is truelly awesome.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The new OS that is bundeled with it is awesome too!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Panther is so cool!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have Expos on and its is sooo handy!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can go from window to window so easily, seamlessly, flawlessly, and quickly, without any clutter or confusion of any kind!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its so fast too!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can have no windows on the desktop viewable, but hit the option key ( in my case anyway ), and bang!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"All the windows that you might have open, are right there at your finger tips.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's nothing short of genius.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"More about the hardware: The graphics on this computer are great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Playing Quake 3, Unreal 2024, All the high end, graphically demanding games glide on this computer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I get more frames per second in both games than I would ever need!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In Quake 2, running at 1600x1200, with 32-bit color, maximum texturing etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was still pulling off 320 frames per second.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thats just amazing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know the specific number of frames on the newer games, but in Q2 I was getting incredible frames.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have the second rate video card in there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can only imagine what the faster machines get.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is tons of free software that comes with this computer!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"iTunes4, iMovie, iPhoto, iChat

negative"},{"sentence":"It's not available for Windows, but still.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The iTunes music store is a way for both the record companies, and the users to feel satisfied.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are great deals.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"$ 10 for most CD's!? Thats a steal compared to most.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Powermac G5 is a great computer for anyone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is more than capable for any task thrown at it, and it has power to spare.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's free packaged Software are a plus, and the new Operating Sustem is brilliant!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have had my G5 for about a month.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And I really love it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I went to the local Apple store to get my G5.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I got the Dual 2gHz Model with 512 Meg memory, 160 G hard drive, DVD RW/R/CD-R/RW and Radeon 9600.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"OS: OSX 10.3 ( Panther )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I brought it home, made my connections to the appropriate periphials, and turned it on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The welcome screen came up within a matter of SECONDS.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was the first clue that this really IS a fast machine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I registered and then logged in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After I loaded all of my software ( which took me about 2 hours ) I started playing around with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have a lot of graphic intensive and memory hogging software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro, DVD Studio Pro, etc. ALL of them it handled like butta!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Plusses:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's FAST.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This machine handles processes SO efficiently and it shows because moving from one command to the next it really does zip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, when rebooting, it reboots within 15 seconds - if that doesn't tell you something I don't know will!!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's FAST.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Burining DVDs and CDs are LIGHTENING fast!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Seriously, within 3 or 4 minutes in most cases.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's incredible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's EXPANDABLE.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's true that the G5 isn't as expandable as one would think for a machine of this caliber and price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I really don't find it necessary.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can have 2 hard drives, up to 8 GB of memory, it has 4 additional PCI slots on the back for additional expansion cards, it can have only one CD ROM/DVD ROM slot but why do you need more than one anyway?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has 4 USB ports and 3 firewire ports including the 800 Firewire.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Optical Digital input and output.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would say it has everything you need.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I do a lot of video editing as well as design and I use everything this machine has and I haven't done anything to expand it with the exception of additional memory and a pre-existing Firewire drive I had.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's Beautiful: It is as sexy as a machine can get.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Keeps its word: It does everything they say it will do and more and does it fast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"THE CONS:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No Virtual PC: I only ever used Virtual PC to use Microsoft Access which is unavailable for the MAC.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You cannot use Virtual PC on a G5 due to some technical stuff - the G5 doesn't posess something that G4's had and which VPC ran on.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So sorry if you depend on Virtual PC I'd wait until Microsoft comes out with the new version ( probably in another year or so ) as they are not releasing a patch","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"CRASHING: The first 3 days I had my G5 it crashed A LOT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At least 5 or 6 times a day.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I suspect that it was because of software compatability issues but still it was annoying and disconcerting after spending $ 3000 on it and I never had this problem on my Powerbook G4.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, that issue seems to have subsided as it no longer happens.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Only certain programs would crash and that seems to have been rectified by adding more memory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So now, it works great!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's BIG: I don't really consider this a plus or minus but I'm putting it here for those with a premium on space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's EXPENSIVE: I don't mind paying a lot for something that is worth it and this machine is worth it but it was still A LOT even with my student discount.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Guess that's all I have to say.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's a great machine","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The PowerMac G5 is a computer designed for two types of person: The power-mad user of CPU-sapping programs like Final Cut Pro and After Effects, and the person who just wants to look like one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the latter type, Apple has an entirely new case design, one that is beautifully made, but looks formal, stiff, a little stand-offish.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is not warm and fuzzy; my friend Amber will not hug it, as she did my PowerMac G4 at work; she would probably slide a finger or two over it, admiring the smooth, brushed-aluminum surface.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In short, it looks impressive, much more impressive, a formidable piece of engineering.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But those who like to hug computers might want to find one of the last old G4 models.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The G5 is taller and somewhat thinner than the old model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's lighter, being made of aluminum instead of steel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Setup and Installation","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Setup and installation are, as usual, done with the same meticulous good taste and sleekness of all Apple products.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You turn it on, plug in the keyboard, mouse and monitor and while it's setting itself up, it treats you to a somehow dazzling but tasteful and understated\" Welcome\" in ten different languages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Subtle and pleasant new age music joins you as you start typing in your registration details.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the process continues, smooth, pleasant and tasteful until it is all done and you have a set up internet connection and all is well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I thought there was a big problem at this point, since the networking didn't work, but due inspection showed that I had simply forgotten to plug in my Ethernet cable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't do that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After that, it started to work flawlessly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't buy computers to look at their case design!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How's it perform?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All routine operations are blisteringly fast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Applications open fast, web pages load fast, even the rather resource-heavy Apple mail runs fast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And all of this happens with a tiny fraction of CPU use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Encouraged by this, I decided on a stress test no computer I'd ever owned could pass.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I decided to try capturing video and then using

jobs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Calphalon pots are heavy and hard to clean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And you can't put them in the dishwasher--they'll get white spots on them ( I tried with one small piece. )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, the very heavy aluminum does work better for some purposes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, I use my Calphalon when I'm searing fish--I need to get the pan very hot first, and the olive oil I'm using ensures the fish won't stick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because the handles are metal, they heat up with the pot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You need a potholder when lifting one of these pots off the stove...and I'm always unsure of my grip when using a potholder to lift a pan with bubbling oil off the stove.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a quick omelet in the morning, I reach for the budged non-stick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Only for special dishes which reqire a hot, smooth, evenly heated surface do I use the Calphalon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We got two pieces of hard-anodized Calphalon for our wedding: the 2.5 quart saucepan with lid and the wok.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At the time it seemed like a good idea.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We didn't want anything with a nonstick coating, but we also didn't want to spend hours scrubbing pots.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Calphalon, with its sturdy anodized finish, appeared to be a good compromise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The heavy aluminum core, we figured, would keep things from burning.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then we opened the boxes and read the directions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't use metal utensils, they said.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't place your Calphalon on more than medium heat.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Don't leave food in it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And don't use a scouring pad.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If we'd wanted to baby our pans like this we would have gotten Teflon!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We did our best but it wasn't long before the pans, especially the saucepan, were nicked and scratched.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They seemed to develop odd filmy stains that couldn't be removed by soaking or scrubbing ( we even cheated and tried a nylon scouring pad ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's hard to say whether the stains were from cooked-on food or from the slowly-dissolving coating.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If food was left in the pans for any length of time beyond a couple of hours the finish started to wear away, exposing the plain aluminum interior.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Calphalon acts... strangely when you put it on a lit burner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It heats up very slowly and never really gets hot, even if you disregard the warning about higher than medium heat.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This makes it hard to saute things, and stir-frying is especially challenging.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also takes a long time to cool down, so that even when you take the pan off the burner the food inside continues to cook.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After the finish started wearing away, the aluminum core made things taste funny, not just acidic foods like tomatoes but even boiling water.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Not exactly what we had in mind when we asked our relatives for this pricey stuff.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Finally, after less than three years, we were forced to toss the saucepan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The wok is still with us, but rarely used.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So my recommendation is: skip the Calphalon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For frying and sauteing, get some nice cheap cast iron; it works better and requires just a minor investment of time at the beginning to get it seasoned.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For boiling and stewing, your basic stainless steel, preferably with a heavy aluminum disk on the bottom, will do just fine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then take the money you've saved and buy some good knives or a Kitchenaid mixer, or stock up your liquor cabinet.","target":"Genuine

recommendation of friends who also are passionate amateurs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Initially, I babied these pans, even though it seemed a little odd that the supposed choice of professional chefs would require this kind of treatment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I mean, any time I watch film footage of restaurant chefs, they are banging their stuff around like crazy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Imagine a high volume restaurant dishwasher gently coddling a pan with Dormand low abrasive cleaner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I, too, used the hideously expensive Dormand cleaner and carefully stacked the pans in the cupboard with towels in between.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Irrespective of this, the finish VERY quickly began to ding and wear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Had I been a little smarter at the time, I would have demanded my money back on the spot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They have never been easy to clean.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They required a great deal of soaking and gentle nylon abrasion over a day or more if something got really stuck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have never been happy with the surface for sauteeing tasks ( although the heating is very even and the pans sit nicely on the burner...the structural integrity is just wonderful ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now, the anodization has completely worn off the bottoms of the saucepans ( the most-used pans for everyday ), and is starting to come off the skillets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After a few years, I gave up completely and now we just stick them in the dishwasher.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Who cares??","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No matter what we did, they seemed to wear out anyhow.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I will never purchase anything again requiring this degree of care.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After reading other Epinions, our next purchase will definitely be All-Clad stainless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I recently received a heavy, multi-ply stainless steel griddle as a gift, and am so happy with its performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thanks for reading and I hope this helps you in your decision.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As someone who loves to cook and enjoys entertaining, I am always trying new recipes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have tried many different types of cookware including Revere Ware and T-FAL, both were fine but I wanted to upgrade to\"restaurant quality\" cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Calphalon was my first choice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The look of it combined with the reputation I was convinced it had made me want it in my own kitchen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bought it piece by piece.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Knowing which pans I would use most, allowed me to purchase just the ones I wanted, as each went on sale.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some even came with videos on how to cook in it and clean it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course, I, being the chef in my own mind, was sure I did not need to view it, but did just for fun.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As I watched, I saw that I needed to use a ScotchBrite pad ( included with the pan and video ) and was told not to ever use dish liquid or put it in the dishwasher, at that point I began to wonder if these pans were going to be a hassle to clean.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But they looked so beautiful hanging from a stainless steel rack, I figured it would be worth it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As I began cooking with my Calphalon I started to become more and more disillusioned.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This commercial-type, quite expensive cookware was not only a chore to clean due to having to use special\"equipment\", but it seemed as though just about everything I created stuck to the pans.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Granted, I was well aware that it was not non-stick, however it truly was incredibly daunting to have to be scraping the bottom and sides of the pan, rather than just stirring the food inside.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I found myself using it just for certain types of cooking and for certain dishes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Basically, I personally am disappointed in the Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized pans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I have recently purchased a Calphalon Hard-Anodized Non-Stick Wok and I love it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It looks beautiful hanging with the others and it used much more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Recently got married and registered for the obligatory kitchen\" stuff\", including a set of calphalon hard-anodized cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I must say I am underwhelmed, considering how much they cost.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"-- Cool things about the pots'n pans:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Glass lids!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't know what I was missing with my old target pots and pans.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When cooking, I want to check the status of the food often and the glass lids are a simple but amazingly effective feature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM The handles don't get hot when the pots are.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM While they're not dishwasher safe ( see below ), they are amazingly easy to clean, cooked in food does slide right off the surface.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Very sturdy.","target":"Genuine

move the larger saucepan when it's full of water.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Not dishwasher safe.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Aww, shucks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've long been one of those people who says\" Hey, why bother scrubbing pots if we have a dishwasher, so what if we can only fit 4 things in before having to reload..\" so I've found this to be a fairly big drawback.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM You can't use metal utensils in them - I'm lazy, I used to grab a spoon from the silverware drawer to stir.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now I have to use an actual *gasp* plastic or wooden spoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Cost.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"$ 200 for a *pot*??","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So overall, I'm sure the calphalons are great for professional cooks who are constantly making things that require these heavy duty pots and pans ( the same type of person who probably pays someone else to wash the dishes ), but for the average joe it's probably not worth it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'd rather buy a set at target and replace it every year for the convenience of being able to put them in the dishwasher and their lighter construction.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The glass lids is the one feature that keeps me using the calph's, so if I ever find a cheaper, lighter, dishwasher safe set with glass lids..","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bought this cookware set because I finally graduated college, got married and decided that I was finished using the\" cheapies\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I decided on this brand because quite a number of professional chefs I know also have these pans in their home kitchens.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was originally very impressed with the set and loved the design and heaviness.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After many uses I have now discovered several items worth mentioning to potential buyers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, on the positive side, I must say that the heat distribution is great and this cookware cooks very evenly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And, as I mentioned before, stylistically they are quite lovely to look at.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They add a touch of class to any kitchen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A problem I have discovered and have been greatly disappointed with is the heat retention and conduction of the handles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have been burned several times now by grabbing on to the handles which appear to have been designed to avoid just such accidents.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know why this occurs but it is a hazard and I have to constantly remember to grab a pot holder before grabbing the handle of the pan or pot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I do A LOT of cooking and this is a huge problem for me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I always wanted professional cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now that I have it - I have the professional burns and scars that come with it!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The danger of using this product ( because they are made to conduct heat and distribute it evenly ) is the handles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"EVERYTHING on these pots and pans gets hot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Until I became fairly use to this my family thought I was going to lose my hands and fingers while cooking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't get me wrong I like the finished product of using my new cookware.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is just the means to the end that is hard for me to overcome, at least until I get it in my head that the handles are VERY HOT!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The food comes out wonderful and takes less time to prepare.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But you think it wouldn't matter whether the handles conducted heat evenly!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just do something with those handles so we don't have to have the professional scars that come with restaurant-like food.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've enjoyed cooking with Le Creuset cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's solid.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It cooks well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It works.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's also heavy to the point where the usage is impaired, the enamel coating doesn't last as long as it should for the price, and some of it is just plain ugly ( see especially the flame orange colour ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And the pans with wooden handles will outlive the handles, another thing not commensurate with the price.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I got rid of most of my Le Creuset in a move -- it is the last cookware you'll ever want if you move a long distance, and the last cookware you'll ever want if you move frequently.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most of mine was actually inherited, which is a bit of a rare thing with pots and pans, and that says nice things about the quality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That I parted ways with these particular family heirlooms doesn't, though.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The handles were starting to go, as was the enamel coating which never stuck me as a good idea in the first place; it is only marginally more'non-stick' than uncoated metals.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And it was just too heavy: it worked well to slow-cook a curry, but boiling something that might require draining -- well, forget it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did put pieces in the oven, a nice bit of functionality, but they were so unpleasant to take out of the oven that I gave up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You may enjoy one or two pieces of Le Creuset for things that want to be slowly cooked at a low, constant temperature, and if you are the type to constantly have an unmoving pot ( of soup stock, porridge, anything ) on your stove, this may also be your cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A small pan would probably turn out some lovely sauces, though only in small quantities -- anything much over a quart suffers from the weight problem so much that it's not worth it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I haven't quite been able to duplicate some of the stews and curries made in the Le Creuset pans, but it's a small price (unlike the retail selling one... ) to pay to be free of pots that were so heavy as to be immobile and unwashable.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yes, Le Creuset is attractive, long lasting and comes in a variety of lovely colors, and are suitable for most heat sources.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, as a classically trained chef and manager of a cookshop, I feel that the disadvantages to owning it far outweigh the advantages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is obviously extremely heavy on it's own without any food in it, and the price tag is quite hefty as well.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Furthermore, if you should happen to chip or crack it in any way, having it re-enameled is as costly as replacing it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another problem...what if you decide to redecorate your kitchen and it's color scheme?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I suggest that you are far better off with stainless steel or anodised cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They can be found in a variety of price ranges, suitable for all heat sources, and fit in with all color schemes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I received a Smoothie Elite as a Christmas gift and was mildly appreciative of the gesture, but needed a blender, so I didn't return it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After using it once, I figured out it would never replace a true blender in my kitchen.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now it's just a prop at my bar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 500-watt pulse-power motor with 3 speeds (on, mix, and smooth ) is loud - almost whiney - more so than other blenders.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What does\"mix\" and\" smooth\" mean anyway?! Give me high and low and we're talking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"56 ounce / 7 cup capacity is quite sufficient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unique stir stick breaks up air pockets, increases mixing efficiency.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But this thing is a nuisance - just gets in the way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I usually just keep the alternate removable lid center on it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The dispenser valve serves smoothies without a mess, but keeps on serving when you don't want it to.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"From day 1 the valve dripped onto the counter after using it once.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's difficult to clean, as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You have to disassemble the entire valve - a 15-minute ordeal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base is oversized and bulky.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The owner's manual suggests not using a dishwasher to clean.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Great...so much for convenience!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As you can see by the title here I'm not a fan of Farberware cookware.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Purchased a set in May and it has not held up to its reputation.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I don't know what they are doing or not doing, but this set left a bad experience for me.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Can't go in the dishwasher, can't use oil or sprays in it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It scratches easily and stains and peels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This cookware is not a cooks friend what so ever!! Shipped set back to Meyer corp.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"and would you believe they didn't stand behind their\" Lifetime Limited Waranty\" due to their explanation of telling me that is was not defective.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Well if peeling and scratching aren't covered under this\"WARRANTY\" after less than 3 months use then I have no clue what is covered.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It cost me over $ 15 to return and they send me back the exact set.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is this customer service?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is this what we buy now is use for less than 90 days and throw the cookware away?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are considering purchasing this\" stuff\" I'd think twice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's not worth the price or the hassel","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Lodge is celebrating 100 years of making pans cast from iron.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They even have a special cookbook to go with the Lodge pans which is available at the web site.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lodge makes the entire pan in a cast ( mold ) which is where the cast name comes from, and the pan is made out of iron.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why should you care about a pan being a cast iron?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well--lots of pans fall apart.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pieces come off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The finish flakes off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That doesn't happen with a pan cast in one solid piece and made of iron.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As for the iron--iron has been used for centuries in cooking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It holds up to the heat and it absorbs the heat and cooks evenly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is not a smooth finish like most pans.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It has pores which absorb oil ( which means these pans get better over time ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also the iron gets in the food ( faint traces ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is fine and actually a good thing, since we all need iron in our diet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are anemic, then you might want to consider cast iron for cooking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lodge makes a variety of sizes from the tiny one you see in the product to picture up to the large size in the picture.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I do like the small size for meling butter for popcorn or for frying onions to go on a sandwich.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The larger sizes are a problem though due to the weight.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cast iron is heavier than other types of cooking materials.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lodge also has the cookbook plus items like covers for the pans ( though I just use a regular lid ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They have other kinds of pans like a wok and Dutch oven.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually the 20SK2 is not even pictured for you to look at.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is a two handled huge sized pan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is 20 inches in diameter and 2 1/4 inches deep.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In other words this pan is almost 2 feet across.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since cast iron is heavy, this pan weighs in at 27 pounds and then more when filled with food.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would suggest the Lodge 3 piece pan set.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That comes with 3 pans that are approx 8, 10, and 12 inches.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Those are the sizes I generally use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The small size is nice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The large ones are just too heavy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I have to cook those kinds of quantities, then I use a stew pot and make soup or stew or something like that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a large skillet meal, I'd go with a lighter weight cookware product.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe the model number is a mistake on this item.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Note that you see a price of $ 5 to $ 35.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, that jumbo Lodge runs almost $ 160.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But this model number is the big pan, and I would not use that order number unless you really do want this really large pan.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The only way I could see this pan as a good buy is if you own a restaurant.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even then I don't think you could hire many people who could really handle 27 pounds of pan.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Not only is it hard to move the pan around to cook, it is really hard to wash such a large and heavy pan.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Don't give up on cast iron based on this pan.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Check out my review and others on other Lodge pans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They really are fabulous pans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cast iron does require seasoning with lard or crisco ( and not just oil ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You rub that in and then heat the pan on 200 degrees for a couple of hours.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A newly seasoned pan is best for meat of deep frying ( they do have a deep fryer in fact but you can use the regular fry pan ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To start with you want to build up the oil base.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then you can cook most anything in the cast iron.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Tomato based products tend to break down the seasoning, but other items are fine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although some people do baby the cast iron and scrape out and wipe or use a special sand cleaner, I just wash mine right in the sink.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't let them sit in the water though as that can cause rust.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If a pan does rust, then just use a brillo pad and rub down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then reseason.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They can be recovered easily as I have had them rust during military transitions when they are in storage for months.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Do not buy these spoons if you are looking for a decent product.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yes these spoons are modestly priced, but the quality is highly lacking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My first impression, was\"what the hell are these\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Upon inspection of the spoons they appear to be a cheap type of\"pot metal\" stamping.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The finish on most of the spoons was a flat unpolished grey color.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only part of the spoon that was even remotely shiny was the head of the spoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It looks like a big machine stamped them out and then some poor enslaved Chinese 12 year old was forced to quickly ( and unevenly ) polish just the part of the spoon you put into your mouth.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As was evidenced by each spoon having a very nice\"made in China\" sticker on it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However each spoon on the bottom has unevenly stamped into it the words,\" stainless steel\" which is about the only indication that these are actually stainless steel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To be honest I think that it is stamped there just to make you believe that they are stainless steel and keep you from immediately demanding a refund.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We received this Farberware stainless steel set when we got married and found them to be great at first.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, we did end up having some problems with them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The main problem we had was with the handles coming unscrewed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We kept screwing them back in time after time and they kept loosening up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We ended up having to send three of the pans back for repair--which they did gladly ( we had to pay to ship them for repair ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So on this note, we were very pleased with the warranty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other problem we had was with the smallest sauce pan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One day, we noticed that the lip of the pan was cracking at the top.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since we had always followed the care instructions, I'm not sure why this happened.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, we do use babysitters who have used our pans so maybe they caused the problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Who knows?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, we are still waiting to get our replacement pan from Farberware since the repair place couldn't repair it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"On a more positive note, I have loved the fact that these pans aren't too heavy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We have some Scanpan 2000 pans that are sooooo heavy ( I know they have some lighter ones now )!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, this set seems to have everything you need for basic cooking in the kitchen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only thing I wish it had was a small omelet pan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would recommend not placing these pans in the dishwasher.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Although the instructions do say\"dishwasher safe,\" I think they will last longer if you wash them by hand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the price, I think this is a worthwhile set.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, you may have some problems like I did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At least the warranty is what they say it is and that gives me more confidence in the product","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you like washing dishes all of the time, this cookware set is for you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes, they cook great and they are classics, probably before the turn of the century!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't buy if you cook low fat meals as you must use oil to keep everything from sticking.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can wash in the dishwasher and use metal tools, but I bought non-stick skillets because I was tired of scrubbing and soaking before I put them in the dishwasher.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My mom told me the other day that she had a set that she bought before I was born ( 1950's ) and I don't remember ever seeing them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She said because she spent all of her time scrubbing and soaking them so now she uses non-stick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are great for frying and browning foods but do yourself a favor and purchase some additional non-stick cookware too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I got married my mother bought me a set of Revere Ware and my mother-in-law bought me a set of Farberware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each swore up and down that their choice was the best set of dishes on earth.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well after 4 years of testing, I have to say that my choice is Revere Ware!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found the Farberware to not be so durable.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For starters, the handles fell off two pans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Second, I dropped a Farberware pan once and it cracked in the rim.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Third, I dropped my farberware skillet and revere ware skillet one day while cleaning.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My farberware skillet is now oval not round.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My revere ware skillet is just fine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fourth,

thin stainless steel - the aluminum bottom is just that - on the bottom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This causes sauces, soups, etc - anything liquid in the pan - to scorch along the outside edge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Any serious cook will spend the extra cash on All-Clad - at least for a few key pieces, such as a Saute Pan, Fry Pan, and a good Sauce

fantastic - out of the box.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are shiny and heavy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can feel the quality All-Clad puts into their products.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet, this leads to something I am not too fond of.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However good they look new, they are a killer to take care of.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is recommended that they be handwashed, not for use in dishwashers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I do good to manually wash my hands, let alone dishes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, thats a huge drawback for me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And, beyond individual use cleaning, they are magnets for fingerprints.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, if they are left out ( mine are hung from a rack in the ceiling ) they collect dust.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It takes time to clean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Bottom line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, that being said, I still would recommend them highly.","target":"Genuine

-","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*3qt Saute Pan ( cover included ) - This is my favorite, most versatile piece.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I love it because I often cook for large groups, and this can handle a large amount of food and the 4qt is just a monster!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*8\" skillet - A bit small, but ok for me.","target":"Genuine

extra.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was hard to refuse, although, I must say I have never once used it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"*2qt saucepan ( covered ) - Another staple.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Good for soups, rice dishes, just about anything.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*8qt stockpot ( covered ) - I would say it is a good, versatile piece, but I would be repeating myself too often.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thus, you can see All-Clad does a good job pairing things in its set.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other notes -","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*Warranty - This is another trademark of the brand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had to have a few pieces of my MasterChef replaced, and W-S did so with no difficulty.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It was very simple to just take in my defective piece and have it swapped out for a new replacement.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My only concern was that I had the original MasterChef, and they discontinued that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thus, I could only get the new MasterChef II, which is not an identical match to the original series.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That is why I did away with it and went to the Stainless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am a bit OCD, and everything must match in my kitchen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*All-Clad boasts that it is made in the USA.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is something I appreciate greatly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I am VERY disappointed in All-Clad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They sell a set of 2 individual oval bakers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These are much more flimsy than the standard All-Clad, and when turned over, they reveal a sticker claiming\" Made in China.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a disappointment in Quality/Brand control!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*There are many more pieces I plan to get as my needs expand ( and my ceiling space to hang them! ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could buy every piece, but then it might take over my apartment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, my set included no non-stick pieces.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Although I prefer the standard coating, I think it might be nice to have a few pieces for certain dishes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I guess it is only befitting that since I wrote a review about a potato masher that I should write about the companion piece that usually goes along with it hand and hand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When purchasing a peeler I always try to look for something with a handle that if large enough to grip and not cut into the palms of your hand when you are using it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have tried the Ecco but they are so very uncomfortable as the handle is made of a thin wire that does cut in to the palms of your hand and the blade is hard to control.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I was in Wal-Mart one day I discovered the Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler quite by accident.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had ground my old Ecco peeler in the garbage disposal by accident and needed something to replace it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I saw the Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler hanging on the display and thought I would give it a try.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler says it is made of steel but there is a major difference between it and the Ecco.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handle of the Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler is quite large and made out of a rubber so that when your hands are wet it doesn't seem to slide around nearly as much.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That makes your peeling time less and your hands feel more comfortable and not nearly as fatigued.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you are looking for something shiney like the Ecco then I suggest that you stick with Ecco as this peeler isn't it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It has brushed steel so that leaves the shine out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The blade itself it made of steel and has not rusted on me like the Ecco.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I like that a lot since I am not having to replace what seems to be like very other month, in fact I have never replaced the Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler since I bought it over a year ago.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When looking at the Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler you will see that the blade has a elongated hole right down the middle of it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On either side of the hole there is a blade that you can use so that makes it nice for people that are left handed and right handed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also with this blade when scraping vegetables you can go up and down instead of one directions and the blade will catch the skin going both ways.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The blade does swivel back and forth for ease of use but doesn't go too far so that you have trouble.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler measures 7 1/4 inches from the top of the blade to the end of the handle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That makes it nice as it isn't too large but large enough to get the job done effectively.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"On the end of the blade you will see something that resembles a point, this is what you use to remove the eyes from potatoes or spots from your other vegetables.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now the Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler isn't just for potatoes, you can use it for cucumbers, carrots, zucchini, apples, peaches and whatever fruit or vegetable that is firm and has a very thin skin.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Another thing I like the Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler is you can make chocolate curles for cakes and cupcakes by running the blade down the side of a piece of baking chocolate that has been chilled.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are one of these people that prefers to hang thing instead of placing them in the drawer then you are in luck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler does have a hole in the handle for this purpose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I usually just place mine in the drawer and when the dishwasher is too full I slip the handle over one of the spindles in the dishwasher and let it hang so that way I can get it good and clean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The clean up is easy, like I said above, just place in the dishwasher and slip into the drawer when done.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The next time you are looking for a peeler give Oxo 7.25\" Steel Swivel Peeler a try it's worth the extra $ 2.00 that you will spend.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thanks for reading.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am a trained chef and I have owned 2 of my own restaurants and I have to tell you I have never cooked on anything that comes even close to the performance of All-Clad cookware.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Don't get me wrong, I have owned lots of other cookware, but

Calaphon, DON'T waste your hard earned money on this hard anodized cookware, and then there is a very famous chef from Austria that sells his own cookware on HSN network and he claims he uses it in his restaurants.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Mr. Puck might use it in his restaurant but if he does he destroyes a bunch of it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the other hand I did use my All-Clad in both of my restaurants and I'm not saying that I am a famous chef but I am saying that anybody that wants to cook like one of the famous chefs, buy a set of All-Clad cookware.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The reason I love cooking on it so much is the way it conducts heat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And afterall that is what cooking is all about.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The reason All-Clad conducts heat so much better is that they have a stainless steel outside and an aluminum in the middle and another stainless steel skin on the inside of the pans or pots.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Stainless steel is a great metal but it doesn't conduct heat very evenly, on the other hand, aluminum is great at conducting heat evenly but it doesn't hold up very well, but put them together and WOW WEE what a wonderful marrage of two great metals.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And if you ever see an All-Clad pan cut in half, you will see what I mean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bottom of all, All-Clad cookware has about 1/4 inch of aluminum sandwitched between two skins of stainless steel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As far a finish is concerned, I have not seen a better set of cookware in my life.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you want to keep the beautiful finish on your All-Clad cookware dont use steel wool or the green scotchbrite sponges or pads on the outside of your pots and pans.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"All-Clad does make many types of exterior materials for there cookware or I should say finishes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The one I use is the bright Stainless steel inside and out, but they have the chefs style which is a dull stainless outside and.They also have the LTD version and that is black on the outside and they also have the Copper but I don't know much about this beautiful cookware except that it is the most expensive and most likely the best at conducting heat and keeping it hot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could go on and on about how wonderful this cookware is, but the bottom line is you should try it for yourself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you can't afford a whole set, buy one peice and see for yourself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did read some other reviews and the reviewers said that the thing they didn't like about All-Clad cookware is that it was hard to clean, NO WAY!!!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"it is harder than a non stick surface, but if you really burn something into the pan just put a small amount of Dawn and a little bit of water in the pan or pot and let it soak and in a few minutes it will come clean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The good really out weighs the bad when it comes to All-Clad cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"hello,","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"one of my favorite hobbies is cooking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i have

techniques to cook the things i loved, i was more than content.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"this line of cookware allowed me to push the boundaries of what i was used to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"caramelization was easier and simmering was more even.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i didn't believe it at first that cookware made such a difference but now i do!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"i don't like the master-chef line.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"no performance reason, just for me, the black is

the kitchen aid line while window shopping.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"it seems they tried to copy all-clad in design and function.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the handle seemed uncomfortable and was not balanced.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"calphalon has a similar handle to all-clad and the balance is pretty good but the line is mostly aluminum and a lot of their lines have glass lids which for me ( who has worked in three different restaurants as chefs while attending university ) is silly as one is bound to'drop' things, especially lids.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"if i were to open a restaurant, i would definitely have all-clad as my main cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"a distant second choice would be calphalon stainless line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"take care!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I woke up one morning with one thought... I am 35 years old, a good cook, and it's high time I bought a REAL set of cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A full set, and, yes, if need be, an expensive set!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luckily, I could further justify my purchase with two facts: one, it was Mother's Day, and I am a mother; two, I ran a home daycare at the time, and could write it off as a business expense!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Feeling uncharacteristically decadent, I set of to the chicly overpriced Williams Sonoma, giddy with the thought of putting all my old, dilapidated cookware out to pasture to make room for the shiny new.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sales lady was matronly, kind, and almost frighteningly astute about the many different types of cookware they offered.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had my eye on the copper, which was the most expensive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She discouraged me at once, agreeing it was the most beautiful, but... the polishing....

I'd be sorry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And then I saw them... the All Clad, beaming at me, nay, beckoning me from the far wall.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Stylishly minimalist looking... I liked that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Aluminum core with stainless steel food surface... that was a good thing, too, since my husband is convinced that cooking on aluminum surfaces

560.00.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This included 2 fry pans ( one very large with a lid ), a stock pot with lid, a sauce pan ( small pot, very handy ) with lid, and a 3 piece double boiler, ( steamer ) my personal favorite.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since they were throwing in the extra smaller fry pan, that made TEN pieces in all, including lids the way they do.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I personally think counting the lid as a'piece' is sort of a stretch, don't you?... kind of like trying to count one's dog as a dependent at tax time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, my set did not include the piece shown in the photo for this category, so i figure since the time I purchased my'Stainless' set, they must have taken out a piece and replaced it with the pasta insert.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Or maybe they just chose any pretty piece of ALL CLAD Stainless for the photo, even if it isn't in the set.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Who knows.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even given the extra pan I'd be getting, the price seemed a bit ludicrous, even in my self-indulgent frame of mind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I mean, we were talking about pots and pans, for god's sake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My husband's face looked a little greenish and moist.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I vaguely recall him stammering something about being able to buy quite competent cookware elsewhere for a lot less.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I didn't trust him.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I trusted HER.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And over two years later, I'm not sorry.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Here's why:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"PROS:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Downright elegant looking... very

negative"},{"sentence":"LIFETIME Warranty","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"CONS:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's important to note that the makers of ALL CLAD say that because of this product's aluminum core and excellent conductivity, it is never necessary to use high heat to cook or brown foods.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is true, but requires a little patience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because if you don't remember to refrain from cooking on high, food WILL stick if you're frying, even with oil spray or butter.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But if you're patient and cook on medium, you CAN fry beautifully in these pans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Food cooking surface will show very mild scratch marks and slight rainbow colored haziness if you use metal cooking utensils regularly, or of you scrub too hard or burn something.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is mortifying!... like getting that first scuff mark on a black suede purse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It can be helpful to call a friend to help\"talk you down\" when the first scratch occurs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Says\"dish washer safe\" in the insert info, and their web site says that's O.K. for their Stainless line, but their recommended cleaning method is with a low-abrasive cleanser called\" Bar Keeper's Friend,\" which also supposedly removes any of that'cloudy rainbow' discoloration that can crop up over time if high heat is used.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I use\" Bon Ami\" cleaner, also a low abrasion brand, and I hand wash my set to try to preserve the high polish shine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have to admit, hand washing is a little inconvenient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But all things that last ( wether it's a great marriage or a great fry pan ) require a little extra care... so all said, she was right...I'm glad I got Clad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have one piece of All-Clad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"About a year ago, I needed a pretty pot that I could set out on a buffet table.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rather than buy something decorative I decided to buy something functional but great looking and user-friendly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I fell in love with their Paella Pan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seemed so all-purpose and I had seen the All-Clad label on many exclusive cooking shows.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm hardly an expert chef, but you'd hardly know it from the way people raved about my dish and the great looking presentation my All-Clad Paella Pan made.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everyone knows I'm a big fan of stainless-steel cookware in general, but if you are going to spend the money, you might as well get the best.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the best is All-Clad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm telling you, when I come up with enough money I will most certainly invest in a full set of All-Clad as my alternate/special occasion cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't even think of throwing money away on Calphalon.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In the department stores, the Calphalon hard anodized pieces just look plain ugly--a mess waiting to happen, with that anodized residue.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They look like half-done pieces of pottery that have already been burnt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is this a look you want in your kitchen everyday, or for special occasions?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Do you want hard-anodizing to come off on your food?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It certainly came off on my finger when I ran my hand across the Calphalon in the department store!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm saving my pennies, but in the meantime, if fire, flood, or earthquake strikes; the one article from my home that I will make sure to save is my All-Clad paella pan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had ample opportunity to find out before the wedding that my now-husband is not a friend of nonstick cookware.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Metal utensils, scraping with a fork, burning things, steel wool, you name it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So when I went looking for cookware for our gift registry, I only considered stainless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All-Clad had the best selection, the best price, the best handles, you name it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was also recommended by the major nameless consumer guide ( this was in my pre-Epinions days ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We have a winner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handles stay cool on the stove and have such a nice feel to them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pan's shape is just right for sauteeing or omelets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And they clean up easily enough, even when that man I married burns something on the bottom and then doesn't soak it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I handwash everything ( we have no dishwasher ), so ease of cleanup was a major consideration.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I've been especially pleased with my results with grilled-cheese sandwiches in these pans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They turn out much less greasy than those made on the electric grill.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My only real concerns are that the handles are heavy enough that the pan can overbalance if your burner isn't steady, and ours ( old electric rounds ) sometimes aren't.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have to be very careful about that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the pans are heavyish.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Prolonged shaking for sauteeing takes some arm strength.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I *am* something of a wimp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a beautiful set!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"By far, this is the best cookware set I've ever purchased.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A tough competitor to, and better value than Calphalon's Stainless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The special characteristics of this Farberware line is the combination of 18/10 stainless with a mirror-like luster, a Cooper base and long, riveted handles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our new stove has high stovetop grates and was adding too much time to cooking ( pasta water took 1/2 hour to boil ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We decided on FMCC for the good Farberware reputation, and because it offered copper with an aluminum core ( called\" clad\" ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This manufacturing process is well established as an excellent heat conduit = even heating with no hot spots.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Our FMCC set delivers as promised - even cooking and a noticeable shorter cooking time ( pasta water is back to where I was: 12-15 min boil ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cooking is back to a pleasure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Copper bottom will require some maintenance if you want to retain the beauty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Noxon\" does the trick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't had the set long enough to see how the mirror-like finish will stand up.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Stay posted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Matching stainless lids are cast with a recessed rim for good steaming and basting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lids are included on most pieces so you won't have to scramble to find a retrofit or open stock piece.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Farberware went the extra mile and included nice long handles that are elegantly riveted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A simple Fleur de lis pattern at the rivets is a lovely detail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This collection is suitable from oven-to-stovetop so you can go from the cook top to oven and keep food warm last minute.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Baking/browning is also possible though I would never bake in them myself.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Clean up is good too!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our new home has very hard water making all cleanup a chore I'm not used to.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My Calphalon stainless is a nuisance to keep clean within warranty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unlike Calph, this Farberware set has the recessed rim in the lid which is far more manageable in the sink.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Or, if everything goes in your dishwasher, pop your FMCC in - it's safe!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The tips included are thorough and very friendly, unlike the competition.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are 2 sets to choose from: 8 or 10 pieces.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- The 8 piece had a 1.5 and 3 QT sauce/steamer combo, 6 QT stock pot all with rim-fitted covers, and a 10\" open saute ( would have loved a lid here too ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- The 10 piece set adds a 12\" covered skillet w/ helper handle, but substitutes an 8 qt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"covered stockpot w/ steamer insert for the 6 QT stock pot, and a 2 QT sauce for the 1.5 sauce.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"None of the substitions are available in open stock so I'm short the 2 QT saucepan- my preferred size for everyday.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I chose the 8 piece set ( from Amazon.com with a free XL stainless colander +/SYM free shipping ), and purchased another brand 8 QT stockpot to complete my immediate cookware needs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm chomping at the bit for the Farberware Copper 12\" skillet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's next!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Farberware comes with a lifetime warranty, and it has always been a\"no-questions-asked\" replacement policy!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have killed a few Farberware percolators in my day ( on 15 hrs/day ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, when I felt it warranted replacement, my percolator was replaced - quickly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Farberware was sold off to a few years ago to Salton* and I have not had a replacement issue since.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I hope their past protocol

negative"},{"sentence":"I'm hoping they add saucepans and more to open stock soon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, I'm thrilled!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I received one 1.5 qt pot from the Farberware Millennium Stainless Steel Copper clad line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was purchased at a discount home outfitter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I used to work in the housewares dept of a large department store so I know what one should look for in cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here is why this is an excellent line and some things that prevent it from being perfect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior is a high polish interior ( read: very shiny, almost mirror-like ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This prevents heat from escaping out through the sides of the pot so a lower heat setting can be used.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handles are riveted on so they are much sturdier than if they had been electro-welded on ( this is how handles on most pots are affixed ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The copper bottom allows for even heat distribution across the bottom of the pot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Copper also heats up very quickly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pot is also a decent weight, it's durable but not too heavy to use.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are not many things that seriously need to be improved on this pot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The lid could be a little more tight-fitting, in my opinion a little bit too much steam ( and heat ) is able to escape.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handles, which are all metal, have not gotten very hot in my experience but they do become warm so these aren't the best pots for young children to learn how to cook with.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would have preferred a\" capped\" bottom ( when the conductive metal, either aluminum or copper is sandwiched between the stainless steel pot and a stainless steel\" cap\" ) but that I believe my preference is a personal one, I don't think it would have done anything to improve the pot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Cleaning this pot is super easy but I would warn people to take care not to overfill the pot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If the food level goes above the rivets for the handles, it can become harder to clean around the rivets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wrote an earlier opinion on non-stick cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was told by one particular cookware company that non-stick cookware can emit formaldehyde into the air when you cook with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had cooked with an expensive set of non-stick cookware for years, and I found this hard to believe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I did some investigating on the interne, and while some information did confirm this, one manufacturer of non-stick cookware addressed this concern by stating that if nonstick cookware is extremely overheated ( as in unattended cookware ) the fumes could be deadly to birds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They also suggested not keeping your bird near the kitchen, because their respiratory systems are sensitive.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I am a health nut anyway, and like to avoid breathing irritants like aerosol hairspray, fumes from some cleaning products, some scented candles, etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I decided to replace my non-stick cookware.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Search Was On","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before I make any large purchases, and I consider a new set of pots and pans an investment and a large purchase, I check out all the brands on the market.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I speak with people and see what they use and like, and I read epinions!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I kept hearing how people loved their stainless steel pots and pans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also got out my handy Consumer Reports Buying Guide ( I love these guys! ) and read what they had to say.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My main choices, if I didn't want non-stick surfaces, were Commercial-style stainless steel, aluminum, copper, cast iron, or tempered glass.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I had already owned tempered glass in the past and I didn't like the way everything I cooked seemed to burn on the bottom of the pans.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I also had previous experience with aluminum pans with copper bottoms, and the copper was very difficult to keep shiny and new looking and I am wary about the connection between aluminum and Alzheimers ( I won't even use deodorant with aluminum in it, why would I cook with it? )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And cast iron was out, because the one skillet that I own ( just for making my famous biscuits and gravy ) has some upkeep to it to keep it rust free.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That left stainless steel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I spoke with a wealthy friend who has the best of everything and asked her what she cooks with... walla!! - she uses and LOVES stainless steel, with copper sandwiched between the layers of steel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Which Brand of Stainless Steel Should I Buy","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found this set on sale and couldn't pass it up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Very similar pans made by Kirkland were available through Costco, but I liked some features of the Cuisinart and felt the brand name was reliable and if I were going to plan on using these pans for the next 30 years I had better find a company that will be around in 30 years ( in case something needed to be replaced, my collection added to, etc ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This set comes with a stock pot ( 7 quarts ) and two smaller pans - ( 2 3/4 and 2 qt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"sizes ) all with lids, and a skillet that uses the lid from one of the pots.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I plan on adding to it in the future.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can get a spaghetti cooker, a chafing dish, and other styles to match my collection.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In case you aren't aware of it, the lids are considered pieces of the cookware... they are included in the set - this does not come with 7 pots.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The set is 18/10 stainless steel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interior has a semi-mirror look to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handles are welded onto the pots - they are very sturdy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They can be used in the oven, under the broiler, in the freezer and are dishwasher safe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They also come with a lifetime warranty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Product registration is easy, you can do it right online!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What I Like About This Set","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I absolutely love these pots and pans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It took me a little while to get used to them because I have to cook on a lower heat to avoid burning my food, but they cook wonderful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The copper helps distribute the heat evenly and quickly across the bottom surface, and I have not burned anything yet!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They are absolutely gorgeous to look at!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They shine like mirrors!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handles have a nice feel in my hand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am proud to have them in my cupboards, and feel good about cooking with a material that I think is safer for my family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They wash nicely in the dishwasher, but since we have hard

whether or not there's any noise.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I didn't even hear a coin drop.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For me that's not a good sign.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The sound of coins, music, even people screaming ( for winning of course ) is the draw.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Vegas is about excitement and the Riviera was lacking in that department.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are a first time visitor to Vegas, DO NOT STAY AT THE RIVIERA.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As a first timer, I was extremely excited to see all that it had to offer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I booked a room at the Riviera through a travel agency without doing much research.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"All I knew it was that it was cheap and on the north end of the strip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I arrived and was disappointed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not because it was a crummy hotel/casino, its a good clean place with an adequate gambling selection, it just didn't have that overwhelming aspect that the other casinos had.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its small and very unimpressive compared to the others and its quite a walk to the other casinos,( except for the Sahara and Stratosphere ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So if you are wanting to get the full experience the first time, pay a bit more and stay at Treasure Island or something in the midst of everything.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Riviera I think is best for those who have been to Vegas before, want to gamble and have access to the strip, but don't want to pay for all the sights they have seen before.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As a side note, don't waste your money on Crazy Girls, one of their 3 shows, the show is as unimpressive as the hotel and the\" I wanna be'Grace under Fire\" comedian is awful.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Just awful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although I have not had the\"pleasure\" of staying at the Riviera, I have visited the hotel on more than one occasion, mainly on my freebie hunts.( Some","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"casinos give away various promotional items. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am aware that the Riviera is often high on the list of travel package bargains, but it is not a place I would recommend to anyone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For starters, the facade has a large bronze wall sculpture of the thong-wearing showgirls from one of their productions ( Splash?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Crazy Girls? ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Basically it is a wall of butts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Classy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Moving on, the inside is very\"old\" Vegas - tacky old carpeting, bright neon lights, and at one entrance, a carnival con man-type talking into a mike trying to get people to pony up $ 20 for $ 40 or $ 50 worth of slot play, which you are almost guaranteed to lose and then you can pick out a lovely\"prize\" from one of their counters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cheesy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Riviera is located on a part of the Strip that is removed from the more populated, safe, and\"happening\" areas, which are mid-Strip and South Strip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Riviera is located on North Strip and is near the Stratosphere, Circus Circus, Slots-a-Fun, and Silver City.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are all old generation hotels and are a painful walk from the newer properties on the Strip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That part of the Strip is also palpably more seedy - on one occasion I witnessed a man standing next to a garbage can, removing a rubber arm tie from his arm, presumably after shooting up, judging by his appearance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Things like this really take away from a vacation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So for me, the Riviera is not even on my list of\"maybe\" hotels when I go to Vegas.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is with considerable trepidation that I commence on a review of the Benson Hotel that refutes tombarnes' excellent review of this same property.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, one of the hallmarks of a really good hotel is consistency of service, and while I'm willing to concede that my review is based on a sample size of only one, I think my conclusions are nevertheless valid.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And my conclusion is this: you won't find me staying at The Benson again.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As a native Portlander, I have of course always been aware of this place, with its distinctive architecture, prime location, and ridiculously liveried doormen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most locals would not hesitate to name The Benson Hotel as the luxury lodging in town.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's a favorite for wedding nights, prom nights, anniversaries, and probably for sleazy but high-dollar office liaisons too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For my money, however, regardless of your intent, you can do better than The Benson.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hotel:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Built in 1912 by local timber baron Simon Benson, the hotel lobby displays all the style and excess of the boom era in which it was built.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lobby features beautiful wood paneling, ornate finish work, and a chummy bar area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Chandeliers, marble floors, and a grand piano add to the elegance of the space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately ( and this is by no means a phenomenon limited to The Benson ), the lobby also features hoardes of slack-jawed gawkers, at least half of whom are wearing bermuda shorts and talking too loudly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The room isn't especially large, and the hubbub of traffic makes it a less dignified and special place than the decor would suggest.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's a weird preponderance of ashtrays throughout the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think this is a vestigial reminder of the hotels boom days, when smoking was a far more prevalent practice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Every table in the lobby holds an ashtray, despite no olfactory evidence that anyone has actually smoked in that room since Simon Benson and his buddies sparked up their Havanas at the hotels gala opening.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Checking in:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We weren't even planning to stay at The Benson - but a last-minute bid on Priceline landed us a room for around $ 90 - about half the lowest promotional rate available on the hotel website, so we decided to investigate the place.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Best I can tell, the rack rate for rooms at The Benson range from around $ 200 to well over $ 500 per night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When we checked in, the desk clerk offered us our choice of a smoking room with a king-sized bed or a non-smoking room with two double beds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I realize that Priceline makes no guarantees regarding the room, but my usual experience is that the hotel will do its best to accommodate visitor preferences.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Not so at The Benson.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Our choices were offered in such a desultory, offhand,\"take it or leave it\" fashion that I got peeved and loudly suggested that we indeed leave it and find lodging elsewhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cooler-headed PrfStars prevailed upon me to take the room with two double beds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our room:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Upon entering the elevator, we experienced a momentary burst of enthusiasm when we realized that our 12th floor room was at the top of the hotel, with only the astronomically-priced penthouse suites above us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Upon entering our room, however, all thoughts of luxury and/or panoramic views fled.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our room was, uh, cozy, particularly given the large footprint of two double beds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, any consideration of the room and its amenities was completely overshadowed by the view, which was spectacularly bad - indeed, I don't know that I've ever experienced a worse one.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you want to experience our view, step outside, stand in a parking lot, bend 90 degrees at the waist and focus intently on the view at your feet - that's what we saw ( minus your feet, of course ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our windows looked about 30 feet directly across an interior airwell to an absolutely featureless concrete wall.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The scary part, of course, is that we were near the very top of the building, and benefited from at least a little light from the sky - I really pity the poor folks who pay rack rate for a gloomy fourth floor view of the same thing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For an old building, the room was in adequate, if not pristine, condition.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Lighting was sketchy at best... at some point in the evening I tried to find something in the closet, and it was only by dumb luck that my flailing arms hit a dangling string that was attached to a bulb in the closet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Additionally, the desk lamp ( which provided the only light other than the wall switch-controlled bedside lamp ) was inoperable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The walls and fixtures were in decent shape, with trademark beige, white, and black window coverings and shower curtain ( which I found eerily reminiscent of Yasser Arafat's headcovering ), mottled beige walls, a couple of boring pictures, and so-so linens.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Amenities included a ludicrously-priced honor bar, two nice terrycloth robes, and a two-line phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Resident bathroom expert PrfStars reports that that room suffered from the lack of a fan and that the toiletries were only marginal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead of separate shampoo and conditioner, The Benson offers a\" conditioning shampoo\", which is evidently a bad thing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did nt know that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, in addition, a small shelf in the bathroom held a shower cap ( does anyone actually use those anymore? ), sewing kit, rosemary-scented body wash (\" Who wants to smell like focaccia?\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"PrfStars ), and of course the obligatory lint-free all-purpose cloth thing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh, and a glass jar of cotton balls and swabs, which sort of skeeved me, like other people had been fumbling around in the same jar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Benson offers nightly turn-down service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When we returned from dinner, our room had been straightened up, sheets turned down, and a couple of chocolates placed on the nightstand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hideous lite rock music was softly playing from the bedside clock radio.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nevertheless, it was a nice touch, I guess.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A final, comprehensive gripe:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The most significant impression I got from our stay at The Benson was of rampant and utterly unwarranted price gouging.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have no problem with a hotel charging premium prices for unique and/or high quality products.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Indeed, it s sometimes fun to splurge on such luxuries.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But when Im asked to pay three or four times the market price for ubiquitous, easily obtainable things, I just feel exploited.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms are substantially overpriced, at least at the rates that most guests will pay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ancillary services, such as parking, honor bar, laundry, and business services are equally inflated.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But nowhere is overpricing more evident than in the hotel's dining options.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Benson has two associated restaurants: the London Grill, located in the gloomy depths of the hotels basement, and the Gaucho Steakhouse, located at street level adjacent to the lobby.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both offer decent, if stuffy, food and service at prices that make places like The Palm or Mortons seem like a Vegas buffet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We happily passed on both.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Similarly, the room service menu was so inflated as to be utterly laughable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cheapest meal on the menu, a continental breakfast consisting of bread, fruit, yogurt, juice, and coffee, was $ 16.00, plus an obligatory 15 % gratuity, plus a $ 2.00 delivery charge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thats $ 20.40 for a breakfast that has an intrinsic value of about five bucks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Include me out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Conclusion:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So maybe I'm being a little harsh - after all, we were low-rent Priceline customers, right?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Wrong.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, I mean, we were low-rent Priceline customers, but I don't think that should ever be a reason for less than standard service - therefore, I have to conclude that even had we paid full rate, we would likely have received the same service, the same room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The combination of ho-hum service, marginal rooms, and sky-high prices was simply unacceptable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With an abundance of nearby lodging and dining alternatives, I dont see any compelling reason to ever visit The Benson Hotel again.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"An excerpt from the hotel website gives some insight into the weird combination of hauteur and sloppiness that, to me, typify the hotel:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" The Benson Hotel in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon, provides travelers a truly unique experience among even the most distinct Portland hotels.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I can intuitively grasp what this tortured sentence is attempting to say, I really wish someone would shoot it in the head and put it out of my misery.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My experience at the W New York disappointed on almost every level.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Checking in, there was absolutely no recognition of my platinum status.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When I asked about a suite upgrade, I was told that I had been upgraded to a business room but that no suites were available.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I thanked the cast member, walked upstairs and called SPG.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They confirmed that suites were available and at my request, they called the hotel manager.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I returned to the desk, lo and behold, I had been upgraded to a suite.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just wish it hadn't taken so much effort - it really did colour my entire view of the hotel.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We took the lift upstairs and went to see our new suite.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms were small, like most New York hotels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hallways are very dark, even by W standards.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room was very dark as well, and could really do with additional lighting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Put it on a dimmer if you want to provide ambience, but four 40 watt bulbs are not enough for a two bedroom suite.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Even my young eyes complained.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But the dim lighting wasn't enough to hide furniture which should have been replaced eighteen months ago.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The entire room looked very tired.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Drawers didn't fit properly, everything was rickety.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It looked like two-year-old Ikea furniture that had been poorly assembled to start with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not at all like the solid, nice looking furniture I've come across at other W's.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The'down-at-the-heels' trend continued throughout the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our coat hooks were loose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our blinds were frayed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our air conditioning was an antique.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, at least it worked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I understand that on Monday and Tuesday, the hotel was without air conditioning at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In common with every other W I have stayed in, the smoking room I had requested came without any ashtrays.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ironically, every non-smoking room I have stayed in had two ashtrays in the desk drawer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I've specifically asked for a smoking room, please provide me an ashtray.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just might want to smoke.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did have a few pleasant surprises at the W. Walking past Oasis, the lobby bar, I saw an old friend from the W New Orleans tending bar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We talked for several hours as I helped increase her business.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I thought it would be rude not to have a beer or three.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In my opinion, this hotel has had its day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It need a full refit of furnishing and some serious training to the staff before I'd ever return.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The W New York is on Lexington right across from the Waldorf ( which is on Park Ave. ) in Midtown Manhattan.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Whether in NY on business or pleasure, the hotel's location is great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Following Westin's strategy for the W chain, this W was formerly a run down hotel that Westin acquired, restyled and reopened as a W. The rooms are just as small as before but are now nicely appointed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lobby of the hotel is also very nice - very modern and cool with new-age music playing rather loudly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hallways on the room floors are only dimly lit and are well appointed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Being a corporate lawyer I travel to NY a lot and have stayed at the W twice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first time I was in a small room, but it was nicely decorated and sufficient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The second time I could not believe the size of my room - my dorm room in college was larger.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There was no dresser or credenza to store my clothes - only the closet ( which was also very small ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I will not stay at this hotel again just based on the size of this room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I can stay at the Waldorf for $ 10 more ( corporate rate ) and get a much larger room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the room size is awful, the hotel does have some nice touches - the shower head ( no bathtub ) is that very large one that provides a rainfall effect, the room had internet capability, fax machine and the beds are the very nice Westin feather beds.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Another benefit of the hotel is that Whiskey Blue is off the lobby.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This bar is very popular on the weekends and the lines can get long.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Guests at the hotel get immediate access to the bar without waiting in the line.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Note that there is no restaurant at the hotel.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you're considering staying on-site at Disney World, choose a moderate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The All-Star resorts are roughly equivalent to any of a myriad of off-site motels at a Disney price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( Re: HIGH)","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Large groups of junior high and high school kids tend to stay here making the resort noisy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In our first ( and only ) stay here there were two incidents involving kids from these groups.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the first, a group of kids riding the bus back to the resort literally were terrorizing the passengers on the bus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When the bus pulled into the stop, they forced open the back doors of the bus and took off before security could arrive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were not on that bus, but on a bus that had pulled in behind it, and had the opportunity to talk to the people who were coming off of the bus involved.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One woman had two kids in tears and she was on the verge of crying herself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other incident was also on a bus returning as we were subjected to a group of Pee-Wee football players using very colorful language with no regard to the kids around them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Their chaperones could've cared less and were only interested in getting back to the resort so they could\"kick back with a few beers and watch Monday Night Football\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now, while I don't think Disney is responsible for the behavior of these groups, they have also done nothing to curtail their behavior.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Year after year these groups continue to book rooms with no consequence for previous behavior.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We were not the only ones to have these problems.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I know of people who Disney moved to Deluxe and Moderate Resorts after enduring sleepless nights on account of noisy, rowdy behavior.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms at the All-Stars are small.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although it states that it can accomodate four adults, I think four adults would find these quarters to be very cramped.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms have two double beds, one bathroom, a television armoire and a small table with two chairs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead of the bottles of\" Mickey\" shampoo and\" Mickey\" soaps in the bathroom, there is a dispenser in the shower.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Disney cannot guarantee connecting ( or adjoining ) rooms when making a reservation.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Therefore, families or groups traveling together who think the solution is to just book two rooms and open up a door between the rooms can't be guaranteed that will work.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The only case Disney will guarantee this is if you are one adult traveling with four kids - the kids would end up in a room by themselves.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The food courts at the All-Stars have a wide variety of foods available to purchase.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are also crowded and are noisy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is no sit-down restaurant as an alternative.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The food quality is just what I would call adequate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'd much rather go off-site to one of the buffets on 192 such as Ponderosa or Golden Corral.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'd spend less money for at least as good quality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would also not be subjected to cheerleaders who use the food court as their personal grooming space, spraying hairspray into my food.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The pools are more in line with a typical motel rather than the themed pools we've come to expect at Disney Resorts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other Disney Resorts have nice slides or zero-entry depth pools.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many of the Resorts even have one or more\"quiet\" pool areas where you can get away from all of the kids at the main pool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is not the case at the All-Stars.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Everyone uses the same pools.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The closes we found to a quiet pool was just as active as the main pool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In reality, the two are just a short distance apart.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Towels are not provided at the pool and you have to bring your own from your room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The only plus of the All-Stars over off-site is proximity and possibly saving rental car fees due to Disney bus service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On our visit, we found the bus service at this resort to be lacking compared to others.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would never stay at the All-Stars again.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Given the choice, I would rather stay at an off-site resort or at one of the hotels in Downtown Disney.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We have been taking family trips to Disney World since the time this collection of resorts and theme parks was almost Small Town, certainly compared with the mature ( over-developed? )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Disney World of today.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were just three hotels then -- the Contemporary, the Polynesian and the Golf Resort ( since rechristened the Disney Inn and then Shades o'Green ) -- and one attraction, the Magic Kingdom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the intervening years, we stayed at many of the hotels, and at the campground too, and always found the resorts several cuts above those we experienced everywhere else.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Landscaping, imaginative swimming areas, exceptionally attractive rooms and common areas -- the Disney Resorts had it all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And this was true in every price range.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Like most visitors, we found a moderately-priced hotel like Dixie Landings every bit as appealing, and sometimes more appealing, than a super-luxury hotel like the Grand Floridian.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, we were shocked -- There really is no other word -- when we went to check out the All Star Sports Resort.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yo! Giant Coke sculpture; what was that about?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I suppose the several-story-high sports equipment sculptures could be considered fun, but a Coke cup?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Beyond this in-your-face commercialism, the All Star Sports Resort is just tacky looking, sort of a Motel 6 on steroids.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even the doors look cheesy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Part of a complex of similar, themed, low-budget motels the All Stars scream low-budget in a way that lower-priced area motels, including Days Inn and La Quinta, too popular off-site competitors, do not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The All Star resorts look like what they are: Disney's attempt to keep every Orlando dollar onsite.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The company does not want to cede any business to competitors on International Drive, a strip just filled with economical motels, and so it offers this under-$ 100 motel to budget-conscious travelers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fairness, I have read comments on various Disney Internet message boards indicating that many visitors do enjoy their stays here after they get over the initial shock of seeing the place, and most do report that, yes, the giant sculptures are a bit disconcerting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a very large pool, but again, it looks low-budget.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unlike other Disney resort pools, this one is not surrounded by landscaping, and it does not offer shade.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is a cafeteria-style eating area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On our first visit, we noticed that little packets of peanut butter and jelly were out on the condiment counter along with Saltines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We thought that was a nice touch and a great thing for families with small children, but on subsequent visits did not see the peanut butter.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This cafeteria is not exceptional in any way, but is pleasant enough.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The best thing about the All Star Sports Resort is the game room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is big and filled with great sports games, both video and arcade.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This motel complex is not very near any Disney attractions.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Transportation is by bus, and, because there are lots of people staying here, there is some competition for seats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the debate over whether to stay on-site or off-site while visiting Disney World and other Orlando-area attractions, I think if the choice were this motel or an off-site motel, I would go off-site where there are many more attractive lodgings for less money.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think anyone choosing to stay at the All Star Sports Resort would do well to rent a car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This place is pretty isolated from the most desirable sections of the Disney World complex.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are vacationing to Disney and would like to stay at a bargain hotel right on property, then you've come to the right place!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Disney's All Star Sports hotel offers a great price range and houses you close to the Disney magic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms are a decent size and each building is themed to different sporting events like tennis, surfing, baseball, and football.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The scenery around the area is very nice as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I recently took a trip to Disney and stayed at this resort for 8 nights.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms were a decent size.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For each different themed building, there were different accessories to decorate each room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, there were paintings of surfers and beaches in the surfing building.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each room has 2 queen sized bed, but I believe you can also stay in a room with a single, king sized bed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Next to the sink area, there is a closet, a safe, and a bathroom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bathroom itself is quite small, but the shower is a standard size with adjustable water pressure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the room wasn't so bad, there were things that I liked and didn't like about The All Star Sports, like many hotels.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Stars 1, 2, and 3","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are many good things about this resort that helped me to choose it for my stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First: the excellent price I got for nightly stays.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The All-Star Resort offers the cheapest hotel rate in all of Disney property!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Prices can range from $ 89 dollars a night to $ 135, which is really good for staying on property.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Second: The transportation provided by Disney at the All Star is the most efficient method of transportation in all of Disneyworld.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although this may be the cheapest hotel, they sure helped us out on getting from place to place!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On average, I waited about 10 minutes for each bus to arrive to the different parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even better, there is only one stop for many of the busses.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At other hotels, you have to go from place to place to place before you can actually make your way to the park.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Third: The food court provided by the All Star is great!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are many different varieties of food found here, like an Italian place ( pizza, spaghetti/meatballs ), a fastfood stand ( hamburgers, chicken fingers ),\"home-cooked\" meals ( meatloaf ) and an all-day breakfast stand so you can get donuts in the afternoon if you really wanted to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Disney also sells a mug for about $ 10.00 that you can use at the soda machines during your entire stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"10 bucks may seem like a lot right now, but it saves you a lot of money because you can get drinks at your leisure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Not So All Star...","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This resort doesn't deserve 5 stars for a couple different reasons...","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Too many highschool/college kids Being the cheapest hotel on property, this is the ideal location for high school groups or spring break college students to stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many times the gigantic pool is overly crowded and if you're lucky, you won't be able to hear all of the noise that they make at night.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Room Service isn't so Efficient Again, being cheaper than all of the other hotels, the maids seem not to care when they come to clean your room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I've gone out early in the morning and come back to the room at about 2:00pm and the room still hasn't been made up! ( Of course, when they finally do clean the rooms, everything is up to par ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Travelling to the attractions takes a little longer than expected...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you stay on property, you expect to be close to all of the Disney theme parks and attractions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, the only places that you are really close to are Animal Kingdom, the Wide World of Sports, and Blizzard Beach.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything else is at least a 15 minute ride, if not more.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So, Disney gives you a resort at a great value, but there is still a price to pay for what you aren't literally paying for!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This was our 3rd Disney Resort experience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's irrelevant but the year before we stayed at the Disney Inn, which is now the military resort, It was a snooze, nice and quiet but completely older adult resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So going from that to this which was the complete opposite was a big shock!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First off personally I was wanting to stay in the music resort but the siblings sports obsession won.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not that it ended up mattering.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In a nutshell we all hated the resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One thing was the fact that you had to walk through a big food court /entertainment center and then we had to hike what felt like a half a mile to our rooms or back to get to the buses that take you to the parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Which is another thing, the resort seems to be farther from the parks so the bus ride seems to take some time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then there was the sheer tackyness of it all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"eeek it was blinding, all those bright colors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think that it is possible that if you had a younger family they would have enjoyed it more, mine consisted of my mid 40's parents my 20yr old friend and I and my 16 yr old brother and his friend.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were way too many little kids.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pool was a source of frustration for us also.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We really wanted to swim but in a bit more privacy, you can forget about it at the All star resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is one giant pool and its always filled to the brim with small children.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also my parents had a major issue with some teenage kids having a party in the room next to theres...yeah they called the desk...still it just doesn't seem disney.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Basically, we concluded that we would pay the extra 20 or so dollars a night to stay in a different themed resort which would feel more disneyish to us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So probably depending on the age of your family, how important staying on ground and saving that little extra cash is and how calm you want your out of park experience to be you might enjoy your stay there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, my suggestion is to pick a mid range resort and go with that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Something like Caribean or Port Orleans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have stayed at many Ritz-Carlton properties, and I will start by adding that one of my favorite resorts anywhere is the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua on Maui.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, the experience we had at the Ritz-Carlton Boston was completely uncharacteristic of my other experiences and can only be summed up by saying it was HORRIBLE.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My mother and I went to Boston a few years ago for a week as a part of a trip to New England, and we chose the Ritz instead of the Four Seasons since we tend to favor the chain in our travels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We loved the location, which is right across the street from the Public Gardens and Boston Common.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hotel is located a block from the T ( subway ) on the green line, which was also very convenient to use for getting around to go shopping and dining.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The interiors are rather old and in desperate need of the facelift that it is now receiving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, it was nt the aging interiors that turned us off to this property, so facelift or no, a makeover would nt be enough to draw us back to the Ritz-Carlton Boston.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"From the moment we arrived, we were put-off by the snooty attitudes of the staff, but we didn't think too much of it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Our room was in the older half of the hotel overlooking Newbury Street, which wed requested instead of the newer addition on the opposite side of the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Friends of ours had stayed in both the old and new areas and had discouraged us from the newer addition.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We arrived in the late afternoon, so we dropped our bags off in our room and went out in search of a light meal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When we returned to our room, there was a flower arrangement awaiting us with no card, so we assumed that this was an amenity since my mother works in the travel industry.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We settled in, and a little later we received a phone call that room service wanted to deliver a fruit tray to us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We assumed again that this was an amenity as there was no mention of it being a gift, and we declined having it delivered right then.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We instead arranged for delivery the next day since we'd already eaten that evening and wanted to turn in early.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The next day we received a phone call from a close friend and client of my mother's, and after an awkward few minutes, she asked how we enjoyed the gifts she'd arranged for us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm sure she felt rather uncomfortable having to ask us at all, but she thought it was strange that we'd not mentioned it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Imagine our surprise when she told us that she was the one who had sent us the flowers!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She had also arranged for a cheese tray with my favorite cheeses to be delivered, not a fruit tray, and had specified that they be waiting when we arrived since she knew wed be famished after over 12 hours of flying.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She had also sent a check ahead of time and asked the concierge to purchase a gift certificate to Legal Seafood for us to enjoy during our stay and had mailed a hand-written note well in advance to be displayed with these wonderful gifts when we arrived.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of this was paid for in advance with a generous tip included for the concierge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We immediately took this matter up with management who denied any knowledge of these arrangements.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They never apologized, and we never saw the gift certificate, the hand-written note, or the cheese!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The final insult was their response to our friend.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When she called to complain, they lied to her and told her that wed refused the cheese tray delivery and had indeed received the gift certificate and note, and when she told them that shed spoken to us and knew this was nt true, they told her that we were the liars!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She followed up with a letter to their corporate offices, but even that was responded to with a form letter and no personal addressing to the problems.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She and her husband, both frequent, affluent travelers, refuse to stay at any Ritz-Carlton properties since then.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Following our complaints, we received unwelcome glares walking through the lobby, which only served to anger us further.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But the story does nt end there.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you can even believe it, it gets worse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After a few days of being at the hotel, we awoke one morning to the most awful smell. ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We could nt figure out what it was, but we were choking on it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I opened the window to our room, and my mother called downstairs for maintenance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It took them over an hour to arrive, and when the hotel repairman did finally arrive, he told us the Freon from the fridge had leaked or some similar problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I dont know much about things of that sort, but whatever leaked intoxicated the air.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They removed the fridge, which apparently the entire floor of the hotel had complained about, but you know where they put it?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In a maintenance closet on the same floor!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So the stench/choking smell  lingered on the entire floor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was just too much!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We called downstairs again, and fully expecting understanding of the problem, asked to be moved to another room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Simple request, right?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They told us no!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were outraged!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were fully prepared to move to the Four Seasons, but we had only one more night and felt it was nt worth the trouble, that wed simply never return to their Boston property again.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Id also like to comment on the restaurants.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We did not dine in the formal Dining Room upstairs, but we did enjoy a less-formal meal at the cafe on the first floor facing Newbury Street.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have no complaints about spending money on fine dining, but the food here was overpriced and uninspired.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My mother summed it up as mundane at best.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They had a harpist playing, which was nice, but we were unimpressed with the rest of the experience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The waitstaff, however, was attentive and more than satisfactory in their service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Despite our unfortunate experiences with the concierge, front desk, and management, we did have compliments for a few other staff members that did help to brighten our overall dismal stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The doormen recognized us and chatted with us each day when wed return from shopping or sightseeing, and they remembered our names and details about us, which was nice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since the hotel has the only working, manned elevator today, the elevators have attendants  to run them, and one of them allowed me to work it one night, which was fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We also spent an evening in the lounge, and this was by far the only true highlight of our experience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pianist John was so terrific; he knew every tune you could imagine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He actually got everybody in the lounge singing together at one point, and when the waiter came for our drink order, my mom tried something new on his recommendation and was more than satisfied with the concoction he chose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Besides these few gems, though, it was terrible beyond my worst travel nightmares.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was little surprise to us when, shortly after our stay, the property was demoted from a five-diamond property.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want a convenient location, excellent service, and fine accommodations, move about one block down to the Four Seasons.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Website: www.ritzcarlton.com/hotels/boston/","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I recently stayed at the Stratosphere hotel for eight days.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the check in was impressively quick for Las Vegas that is where the first class service ended.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My husband and I got to our room after 12 hours of travel exhausted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room had a unidentifiable stain on the floor which kind of looked like blood, but I cannot be sure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bathtub was dirty - I had to clean it out before I went in there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lighting in the sink area was dim, and for us girls and make up you prefer the bright lights.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not to mention the fact that there was a sound that traveled overhead of the room that sounded like a train on tracks.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We never determined preciously what the sound was.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We were too far from the elevators, the roller coaster on top of the tower does not operate all night long, so that left us curious, but anxious to move rooms.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The manager upgraded us to a player suite which did have better lighting and a marble topped bathroom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also had an extra room with a small chair in it - I would have been outraged if I would have paid the extra $ 20 a night this room was supposidly worth, but we got the upgrade for free so it was fine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We changed rooms late at night and I noticed there was not a\" Do Not Disturb\" sign.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I called housekeeping and requested one and they suggested to simply place the sign outside the door for us since it was late.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The next morning we discovered that we did not have any hot water unless you took a shower early in the morning as we had done on our first day there ( 3 hour time difference from east to west coast ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The shower was luke warm - almost cold so we thought we could combat the cold shower by heating the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most of the time hotel rooms can get extremely warm even beyond the point of comfort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not this room, there was no heat so after the luke warm shower we were faced without the comfort of a warm room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Not to mention the fact that after my cold shower I placed my towel on the floor and was on my way out of the bathroom when the maid walked in with me in my birthday day because we never got that\" Do Not Disturb\" sign as promised.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The housekeeping manager did treat my husband and I to the\" American Superstars\" show in the hotel, which actually was a wonderful performance, but that did not completely supress my anger and embarrassment for myself and I'm sure the maid as well.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My only other positive thing I will say is that they have a wonderful restaurant called,\" Top of the World\" which is located at the top of the tower.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is a revolving restaurant and you can see an entire view of Las Vegas in an hour time frame.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We sat right near the window, had an expensive, but truely good meal and a lovely evening.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Reservations are recommended and you can go to the observation deck for free if you eat there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the managers were apologetic and as helpful as can be I still believe some staples to hotel living are hot water and do not disturb signs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would never stay there again.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would never recommend someone to stay there.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Sure, go see the show and have a meal, but don't sleep there.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It was one of the worst hotels I have ever been in and quite frankly it tainted my stay in Las Vegas a little.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh yes, I almost forgot, on the web site they claim they have three pools.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That appears to be untrue.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The have one pool on the 8th floor, I was told the one on the 24th floor was closed and there was no mention of one on the 6th floor.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can see their\"pool facts\" on http://www.stratospherehotel.com/pool.html.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The casino seemed to be like every other casino in Vegas, with the exception of $ 2.00 BlackJack all day and night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was more geared to those on a budget I suppose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our selection of the Casa Marina for our winter vacation this year was based on our pleasant experience at the sister hotel'Wyndham Reach' adjacent to the property.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Last year we stayed at the Reach and visited the Casa Marina and were intrigued by the setting and facilities.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This year we booked ourselves, our two year old and my sister into the' Casa Marina Resort', with expectations of having a first class experience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, our vacation was anything but that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In all fairness, before I present my laundry list of problems with our rooms, I must say that for the most part the staff was friendly and helpful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The older part of the hotel is quite beautiful and has a wonderful yesteryear romantic quality to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The landscaping is lush and mature and the pools are a pleasure to relax in and around.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beach at the hotel is adequate, but remember, Key West is not really known for its beaches, so our expectations weren't very high on that point.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now the bad and sad part...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We booked two rooms for March 8 through March 15 ( high season ) a double for my sister, and a mini-suite ocean view for ourselves, $ 359 and $ 379 respectively.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had requested adjoining rooms.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our check in was fairly normal, except for the expected\" we don't have the adjoining room available\".","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Okay, well, we can live with that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bellman had difficultly figuring out how to get to our rooms!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was a\" security guard\" there that also had no idea where our rooms were!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That certainly didn't make me feel secure in any way--what kind of\" security guard\" doesn't know the lay of the land in the hotel he works?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I mentioned the'older' part of the hotel before, there is also a'newer' part with rooms and courtyard set up much like any cheap motel anywhere in the country.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And boy was it ever.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This section was where our rooms were located.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were on the top floor ( 4th ) and did have ocean views, through the dense palm treetops.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms were however filthy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The door to the room had a problem with the latching device it didn't function properly half the time and the bottom of the door was rusting and rotting, dropping bits and pieces of sharp metal onto the carpet ( not good for a two year olds little feet! ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was the almost dark brown staining on the carpet, running the entire length of the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was also a kind of wet moldy smell in the room even though the air conditioning was going full blast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I thought,'well, okay, let's give it a chance' We were all so excited to be in a warm place after such a long mean winter we just started unpacking and hit the pool and beach immediately.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over the next day, there were more things that really started to get to me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was thick black mold on the inner shower curtain liner, the bathroom floor had a dirty footprint in the corner that the housekeeper just never seemed to pay attention to.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The floor grout was disgusting, it seems they only wipe the floor and never scrubbed it clean!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The wallpaper was peeling at all the seams ( wallpaper is a dumb idea in tropical weather anyway ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The towel/rack shelf thing was bent and falling off of the wall.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The shower drain was rusty and unclean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I know this is pretty standard, but the water pressure was more like a spritzer bottle than a shower!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The light fixture had two'energy saver' fluourescent bulbs in it that took a very long time to heat up and light the bathroom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of this horror was packed into a teeny tiny cramped little bathroom!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The crib we had requested was covered in dirt and dust, the sheets/pillow were clean the but the crib looked like is had been stored outside.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of the wheels was totally broken off, creating a lopsided slope.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had to clean off the thing myself with a wet washcloth and use some magazines to level the crib so the kid could sleep in it without sliding into one corner!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The rest of the room was okay, a bit run down, the decor was probably nice 10 or 15 years ago when it was done, but the materials and finishes weren't of high enough quality and definitely were deteriorating fast.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Out of three bed pillows two had dark stains on them and smelled really foul.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bed skirt on the bed was six or more inches too long and was very unattractive and had gotten dirty from repeatedly being stepped on and vacummed over.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of the lampshades were stained and loose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The'artwork' consisted of posters that were so faded out that they seemed to be only that funny blue color with a yellow white background.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The mini-bar was adequately and expensively stocked but the laminate surfaces were peeling away at the edges and there was a ton of dust and dirt laying around either side of it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was a safe in the closet--but it was completely useless!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The instructions had worn away so long ago it was good for nothing but taking up space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A quick glance at the climate control and the air vents, showed massive amounts of dust accumulation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our'suite' was nothing more than a standard room with one king bed, and a small sofa and chair jammed into the other corner, a totally generic'shoebox' of a room that even a discount chain hotel would be embarassed to lay claim to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh, by the way, the balcony was spacious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Okay, whew.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well we've stayed in all types of hotels, resorts, guesthouses, villas etc. all over the world.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We spend anywhere between 20K and 50K a year on travel and this next thing was unbelievable to us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Later that morning","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"after returning from the pool, we were walking around our room in our bare feet and noticed something weird.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While we had clean feet ( in our sandals ) back from the pool, our feet were TURNING BLACK from walking around the room on the carpeting!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I couldn't believe this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This has to be one of the all time most disgusting things I have ever experienced in any hotel anywhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That was it, I called to talk to the manager.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I asked that we have a face to face meeting instead of just speaking on the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I went to the front desk and we sat down and I presented him with a list of the problems and wanted to have our rooms switched.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What was the response?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" We'll see what we can do\",\" The hotel is completely booked\"\"blah, blah, blah, blah,\" I wasn't completely satisfied but I said\" Okay, let me know what you can do as soon as you know.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But please don't call the room before 4:00 because the baby is sleeping.\"","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I didn't know what to expect since I have rarely if ever had as many complaints here as anywhere else.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He asked for a copy of my list and I presented it to him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Later that afternoon, a staff member tries to open our door without knocking at 3:30 pm and is barging in with a plastic shower curtain!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I told him to come back later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A few more minutes before 4:00 another person is banging on the door.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is really unbelievable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I specifically said not to disturb us before 4:00 nap time was over.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So much for first-class service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I immediately called the manager again ( after getting our child settled down ) and had to just cut loose.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He asked if our'problems' had been resolved!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Um, no! So, he finally offered to move rooms, not very convenient for us, but I couldn't stand another minute in that room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The new room was in the same section and almost just as bad, but it didn't smell and I knew we would be out of there in a few days never to return to this hotel or any Wyndham Hotel anywhere in the world--EVER.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So this was our'accommodation' trading one dirty room for another.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apologies from the staff: None.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had a terrific time in Key West as long as we didn't spend a minute more than we had to in our so-called'luxury' rooms.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I will never recommend this hotel to any family, friend, co-worker, or stranger on the street.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Wyndham has a lot of work to do if this is what is considered top-drawer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's been one week since I laid my head down in Palace Station, advertised as the place to stay for Vegas locals.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm still shuddering--and my suitcase still reeks of cigarette smoke--after being there for less than 10 hours.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The place was a dump--a supreme, run-down, dirty, less-than-customer-focused, dive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Granted, I paid very little for the room ( $ 35 plus tax, about $ 42 total ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't expect anything fancy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What I got was an experience so rancid, I nearly canceled my good night in Vegas later in the week.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Location","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Off the strip--and not in the nicest area, either.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My cab ride from the airport cost $ 34--thanks to the ripoff artist who took me all over the city.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How would I have known?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My return fare cost $ 8.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Check-in","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't care if it was 2 am--she could have TRIED to get me a non-smoking room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Or a room somewhat close to the main building.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead, I ended up in a smoker, a LONG walk from the front desk; a walk that included an outdoor component through the service area, where several attractive, thin women in mighty short skirts were huddled.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They seemed awfully disappointed when I stomped out the door--but perked up when a man came out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Offered him their company.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hmmmm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Room","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Like I said, for $ 35, it's not bound to be luxurious.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But for that rate, I want my key to work.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When it didn't, I found a casino phone, called for help, and hunkered down to wait for security.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I was waiting, a man offered me $ 20 for 15 minutes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I declined.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sure, it's better money than epinions.com,","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"but hey, I have principles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"$ 5 to the security guy and a 10 minute key struggle later, I was in, locks bolted and AC cranking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The window had both metal and concrete cages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bed was a king, surprisingly firm, with clean sheets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A small armoire housed a TV with cable, and a small table and chairs rounded up the furniture.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cheap indeed, but functional.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Truly hideous color scheme--sort of a brown and orange theme.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was also a large safe, but that required a $ 2 daily fee and I was just there to crash.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Can You Call it a Bathroom if it only has a shower?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Small, functional, and clean, with slippery tiles and a small toilet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Corner shower stall was tiny and efficient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They did provide soap and shampoo.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Casino","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the morning, I decided to play a little.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Real little.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had 5 minutes and $ 50.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After wasting $ 10 in quarters, I sat at a 5 cent machine, popped in $ 5, and promptly won the max jackpot of $ 300.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That, my friends, was the highlight of my stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The casino attendant paid me quickly, in big bills, and seemed pleased when I tipped her.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Granted, it was early, but the casino was fairly empty, and held none of the typical Las Vegas glitz.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If anything, the atmosphere was sort of a 7-11 at 3 am feel--everyone bleary-eyed, pathetic, and desperate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Shops and Restaurants","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't bother.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The gift shops were bigger than I expected, with the usual assortment of Vegas merchandise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Restaurants include the usual mix--buffet, cafe, Tex-Mex, Italian, Steak, and Asian.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Room service was available, but I satisfied myself with snack mix and water from the plane.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With all the creatures crawling in the hallways, I had no desire to meet anything from behind the scenes.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Bottom line","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Never, never, never again.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I sacrificed safety and convenience for the illusion of a low price--and ended up spending the same amount I would've spent for a nice room on the strip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Never mind my $ 300 win.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This place was the worst hotel I've ever endured.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Run!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I recently spent a week in Las Vegas ( again! ), and this time decided to stay off of the Strip and out of the classic Downtown area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I stayed the entire week at Palace Station.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I hate to say it, but what a mistake that was.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't get me wrong.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Palace Station is a great place...if you're a local and like to gamble.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You see, all of the promotions ( money and prize giveaways ) are geared towards the locals.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They give prizes away, but while I was visiting, they were only giving them away weekly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, if, like me, you arrive on a Saturday, and are leaving on Thursday, you miss the Friday drawings!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yikes!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While playing there, I earned a bunch of free tickets to use to enter the drawings, but I had to be PRESENT TO WIN.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a letdown.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With that said, the dealers are overall a pretty friendly lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It appears they see a lot of regulars, so they welcome a fresh face now and then and ask genuine questions about you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wouldn't recommend the food.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Mexican grill was bad - the food was stale.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The diner's service was s l o w.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Did I say slow?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I meant non-existent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I tried the pool a few days as the temperatures were in the high 90's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Get out early as by noon it is taken over by children.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, it was a nice way to wake up and start the day - nothing quite like a dip in the pool at 8am when it's already 88 degrees.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Take note that if you don't rent a car, it will cost you between $ 11-13 each way to get to the Downtown casinos.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That's right, they don't offer a shuttle service to the Downtown area.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, the shuttles that run to and from the Strip stop at midnight.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What Vegas visitor wants to leave the Strip at midnight?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's when the action picks up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I won't be staying at Palace Station again.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'll get back to everyone when I get back from my next trip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the meantime, have fun, win big, and win often!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My husband and I got married in Las Vegas in April 1996.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We stayed at the Palace Station because it was a good deal and out of the way of all of the confusion on the strip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We just loved it!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everyone was very kind and helpful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The casino is the best around....the food is absolutely the best!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room was nice, however, we did not spend much time in the room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In Vegas one does not sleep very much in the town that never sleeps!!!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So, of course, we decided to stay here again on our next trip in 1999.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a mistake!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The food was still wonderful, the casino is still the only won I could win ANY money at, but the service was not up to par.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Our room, with the nasty old carpet and the hole in the bathroom door, was not what I expected after spending so much money for a vacation!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"While inquiring about tickets to a show we were told\" I don't know, call them and find out\"!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As for taking the shuttle to the strip, plan to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The service on the casino floor was very slow at times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At one point I ordered a drink after tracking down a waitress and she never returned.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, I did see her serving the higher priced machines a couple of minutes later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am a very good tipper, which is very important in this town.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On our next trip we are planning to stay elsewhere!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I stayed here for three nights while in Fort Lauderdale on business.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And while this hotel is in dire need of refurbishment, it's location makes up for some of its short comings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I checked into the Sheraton Yankee Clipper Hotel in early December'02.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My accommodations were in the beach tower; in order to get to them, I had to go back outside and walk through the parking area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had a standard ocean view room with typical Sheraton amenities including a king sized bed, 20 inch color TV with cable, computer hook-up, a decent sized bathroom and plenty of complementary toiletries.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was obvious that the room had been updated recently with new window treatments and upholstery.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, the carpeting was stained in places, the furniture somewhat roughed up and the sliding door to the closet ( which wasn't a big deal ) wouldn't close all the way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The clean bath towels provided by the hotel were rough, thin and small.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pillows on the bed were old and flat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had to request extra pillows, and even the ones brought to the room were just as as bad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All hotel towels were the same quality; although I had lots of extras, they were all thin and worn.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bed itself was quite hard, and by the third night, I was dreading having to sleep on it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the beds I checked out seem to be on a concrete platform.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some people, including my husband, might prefer this arrangement.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, it was too stiff for me to ever feel comfortable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hotel was situated in a fairly good location.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The wide stretch of beach along Fort Lauderdale's waterfront was spectacular.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, the lounge chairs and umbrellas on the beach were owned by a concession who charged $ 15/day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I refused to pay this amount to enjoy a few hours in the sun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But most people I spoke to paid to do so, as the hotel's pool areas ( two of them ) consisted of a square pool, concrete decking and few lounge chairs and some tables with umbrellas and chairs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found the pool areas ( one near the beach and one enclosed in between the hotel towers ) to be clean, but it had a motel like feel to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Considering my employer paid a corporate rate ( $ $ $ ), I would have thought for the money, this hotel would have been typical of other Sheraton resorts elsewhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No so.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There was a restaurant on the premises, which always seemed empty, a quiet lounge with happy hour munchies ( not bad ) and entertainment ( at least when I was there ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The vast majority of clientele, from what I could tell, were foreign visitors on holiday or airline employees staying the night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some of the people I ran into on Sunday night were there as part of a pre-cruise package.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Either way, it appears, most people used this hotel only to sleep and to freshen-up by night and go elsewhere for entertainment by day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Sheraton Yankee Clipper had a large motel feel to it, not at all in line with it's size, location and price.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Other hotels in the area had landscaped pool areas where clientele spent more time enjoying the facilities.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One couple I met who was taking a cruise the next day, said they were able to get one night here for $ 40 through Priceline.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think my employer paid about $ 130/night ( corporate rates are pretty high ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One other couple I had met who arranged to stay here with a cruise line said they paid $ 90/night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wouldn't pay more than $ 60-$ 70/night to stay here - in line with what you would pay at some of the other motels near the beach in the area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If there was one positive aspect, it was the hotel's location.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Across the street at the Bahia Mar Hotel, is the water taxi stop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a few bucks, you can take the water taxi to excellent restaurants, shopping and points of interest and tour the mansions of Fort Lauderdale along the water ways while in transit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found it enjoyable during the day as well as at night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beach front by the hotel also offers the best beach volleyball in Fort Lauderdale; good competition if you play and fun to watch if you don't.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are good restaurants a short walk away, and public transportation that picks you up and drops you off at the front of the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cab fare to and from the airport or Port Everglades was around $ 12 including tip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, would I come back here again?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Probably not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For a one night stay, it's probably fine, but given the fact that the Embassy Suites or Amerisuites both have comparable prices and much better amenities ( though NOT on the beach ), I would be inclined to recommend one of them for a pre or post cruise stay.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"On the other hand, if I got the Sheraton Yankee Clipper from a winning Priceline bid of $ 30 or $ 40, I'd consider it a great deal, regardless of my opinion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't forget, my employer paid a lot to have me stay here; under similar circumstances, I'd recommend going elsewhere.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Good luck!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bid for a 3 star on Priceline in the Lake Buena Vista area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This property is located in Kissimmee on 192 ( NOT Lake Buena Vista ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The hotel was clean, attractive, pleasant front desk staff.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The airconditioning was extremely noisy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were Bath and Body Works ammenities in the guest rooms.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, I would not classify it as\" secure.\"","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The first thing I found\"odd\" were the room doors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was the normal latch up top, the dead bolt and an extra dead bolt?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That seemed odd.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everyday when I returned to the hotel, I found pizza fliers under my door ( this is a scam happening in the Orlando area; they obtain your credit card # /# and have fun with it; they attempt to rob you if you order a pizza and they deliver it... ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Security was extremely lax.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I saw a security officer once, on the morning I was leaving the hotel, on the elevator.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you were coming into the hotel from the outside, you could gain access from any door without using a room key.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was scheduled to stay for 6 nites, after 3 nites, I left.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was a female traveling by myself and did not feel safe here.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I left and checked into The Hotel Royal Plaza on Hotel Plaza Boulevard where the Security was stepped up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the property was clean and attractive, safety is paramount.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would not recommend this property for this reason, and this reason alone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It would be foolish to put some clever title on the review of this hotel, because it is exactly what it is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A beautiful hotel, in a perfect location, with large rooms, and an architectural design beyond belief.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We visited this resort for our 25th wedding anniversary.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We traveled in March, which tends to be the high rain season, and it seems that every time we visit a beach resort it rains.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It rained every day, as we were in the midst of a minor storm that had done some damage to the islands.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe that is why we take more cruises, as the ship keeps moving, and the rain can't be there forever.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We booked this trip with United Vacations, and since we had not started traveling as much as we do now, I\" trusted\" their opinions.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I did have some concern because the big hurricane had done severe damage to the island, and we were coming just a year later.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was assured by the United Vacations representative that the island was in perfect condition, which was not the case.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, since that was more than five years ago, no doubt all the damage has been fixed, and the vegetation has grown back.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, I would not recommend United Vacations unless you have really done your homework concerning your chosen destination.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The hotel is a very open concept design that sits on 50 acres of the Poipu Beach District of Kauai.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The grounds were beautiful, and the interior of the hotel was open to the outside, as were all the halls to the various destinations of the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything was protected from the elements, and it gave you a very tropical feeling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the lobby were a beautiful collection of live, native birds, of magnificent colors, some in cages, and some sitting on perches.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Marble and oriental rugs, lush tropical fresh flowers were everywhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is nothing about this hotel that would be a disappointment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are 602 rooms spread out over the large hotel area, and they are only on two floors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had booked a standard room, but I did call the hotel and let them know it was our anniversary, and we received a complimentary upgrade to the Regency Club.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Regency Club consisted of 40 incredibly beautiful room with a private access lounge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room was large, king size bed, interesting furniture, and comfortable chairs, and a patio or balcony depending on the floor you were on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am always fascinated with the bathrooms in these hotels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was again marble, in two compartments, with sliding doors that open up to the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Regency Club was the best one we have ever experienced.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We could not believe the food that they put out, starting with breakfast and ending with evening drinks.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Breakfast contained anything you wanted, lunch was a nice snack, and the evening snacks....well, there was so much food we never ate dinner in a week.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Every night they had a different theme for dinner, and since there was so much to eat, and drink, why pay for a meal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The decor was very comfortable, tropical, and became our little meeting area with friends, because the weather was so bad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beach is supposed to be great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The whole time we were there the red flag was up, so we didn't get in the water.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are two large swimming pools connected by a river like park, and a sand beach.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The weather did give us a little break, and we enjoyed this so much.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The children were having a great time with all the facilities at the pool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sand area is around a five acre saltwater lagoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Frankly, they didn't even need a beach!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One day I had to go to the Spa.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I decided on a package that had a facial, partial massage, and manicure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The price was about $ 100, and it took the whole afternoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The total spa area is 25,000 sq ft, and has it's own partially enclosed pool, elaborate exercise facility, and lava rock showers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This hotel is a real winner, complete with it's own 18 hole golf course.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although I would be cautious about the time of year I visited, I would say there is no way you could be disappointed in your stay here.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Hyatt Regency in Kauai comes very close to being a top notch hotel, in my opinion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We stayed at the Hyatt on our honeymoon - it was the first stop in a two-week honeymoon that took us to 3 hotels ( Four Seasons in Maui and Four Seasons in Kona being the other two ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since this was the first stop, we didn't have the other hotels to compare this one to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That was probably smart because nothing can compare to the Four Seasons.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My biggest complaint about the hotel is that they charge you a daily fee for parking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They charge you whether you choose valet or self park.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Valet is more expensive, of course, but they charge for both.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found this an unnecessary charge for such an upscale hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Okay, now that that is behind us, let's talk about the beauty of this hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The grounds are breathtaking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They landscaped it so that you feel as if you are in a tropical paradise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The best part of the grounds is the lagoon and pools.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pools are all freshwater.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We're not talking about a standard rectangular pool - the pools are like meandering paths that curve around and go under foot bridges, under rock bridges, etc.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The pools are on multiple levels with waterfalls between the levels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All around the pools are sun decks with lounge chairs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And then there is the lagoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lagoon is salt water with an artificial sand-like bottom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I say sand-like because the sand pieces are way too large to be natural sand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I first saw this, I couldn't understand why they used it but it became apparent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When walking on it, it doesn't stick to your feet!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The individual pieces are too big!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How clever.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Swimming in the lagoon was more fun than the pools, in my opinion, because it felt more like swimming in a natural setting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The deep end of the lagoon is also used for scuba diving classes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had a large room with a balcony that contained a king bed and a full bed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm not sure if we were upgraded because it was our honeymoon or if because they were only at 40 % occupancy at the time but who cares.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have two minor complaints about the room - the very small TV - I don't know the exact dimensions of it but it was definitely smaller than a 20 inch.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The other complaint was the bathroom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I guess I am spoiled thinking back to the Four Seasons bathroom and I guess it is unfair to compare them because the Hyatt bathroom was completely adequate - just not up to par with the Four Seasons.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Our package at the Hyatt included free continental breakfast every morning.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is key.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To pay for a full breakfast at these hotels will set you back a hefty sum so the free all-you-can-eat setup was a definite plus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We ate in an open air setting adjacent to a small pond with swans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Perfect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The main lobby of the hotel is beautiful - kind of indoors and kind of outdoors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually, the entire hotel is kind of indoors and kind of outdoors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There will be a room with an entire wall that just isn't there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A bit hard to describe but you'll know what I mean when you see it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Makes you wonder what they do in bad weather.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the hotel is situated adjacent to a beach, the beach is not among the best I've seen.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"First of all, the water is way too rough in this part of Kauai to swim in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beach itself was a big narrow and not the clean white sand you think of when thinking of Hawaii.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, the hotel is on the southeast side of the island so there were no sunsets over the water.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We did see some very nice rainbows though!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We ate in all the restaurants at the hotel at least once.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All excellent and exactly what you'd expect at an expensive hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cost of dinner for two can easily exceed $ 100 with wine, etc. so be careful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would have liked a complimentary newspaper each morning but that would have cost extra...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are into spas, I'm told the Hyatt's is above average in quality and in price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not too surprising - that is a recurring theme at this hotel.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I didn't go to the spa myself so I cannot comment on it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"On the one rainy day we experienced, we asked the concierge what there is to do when it rains.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were told to go to the movies or to go bowling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I did not go all the way to Hawaii to do either of those.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We were on our honeymoon so we didn't really care about being stuck in our room while it rained.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a great Tahoe hotel!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"An older resort, it is nice although somewhat unspectacular when you drive up for the first time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then, when you walk out of the snow and into the lobby....well, WOW!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The expansive lobby area is dark, warm, and decorated in beautiful, rustic, mountain chic...with lots of dark wood, stone, and high beams.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Big fireplaces were going with cozy leather furniture groupings around each, almost begging us to curl up there with a warming libation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My husband and I visited the week before Christmas, and the numerous, beautifully decorated lobby trees only enhanced the ambiance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Service was good, if rather laid-back.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was not necessarily a bad thing, but was rather in keeping with the general tone of this quaint, slow-paced resort town.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It was there if you needed it, but not in the in-your-face-everywhere-you-turn sort of way that it is, for instance, on a cruise ship.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The hotel employees were generally informal, friendly and helpful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only negative that comes to mind was a kiosk set up near the main elevators from which time-share hawkers continuously beckoned hotel guests as they came to and from their rooms.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Walking by several times per day was almost unavoidable, and we were somewhat rabidly solicited about half a dozen times during our 5-night visit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We got a King Hotel Room, and we were extremely happy with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was newly decorated ( and looked it ), furnished in sort of a rustic-yet-contemporary style with an earthtone pallette.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had a spacious, well lighted bathroom ( always a big plus for me! ), large closet, mini-bar, armoire with television, work/entertainment table and chairs, and what was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bed had a fantastic mattress and box spring ( which is sometimes aggravatingly absent ), and TWO sheets with a soft, thermal blanket between them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was topped with a heavy down comforter, and was just fabulous to sink into after a day of skiing while the snow swirled and wind howled outside.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were on the 7th floor, and had a breathtaking view from our large windows of both the mountains and lake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The resort boasts an absolutely beautiful restaurant and lounge called the Lone Eagle Grille.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You do have a short walk to get to it, as it is located across the street ( directly on the shore of Lake Tahoe ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well worth the hike, even in the snow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was built in a 1920's lakefront lodge style, and is exquisitely warm and romantic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Huge picture windows face out over the lake, and outdoor fireplaces were burning on the lakefront patio where a well-bundled, impervious-to-cold crowd sipped cocktails.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Inside, large fireplaces burned continuously and more of the vintage mountain decor prevailed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On one side, a light appetizer menu was served along with an extensive list of martinis and other libations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other side of the lodge is an upscale restaurant ( which we didn't try, but looked to be doing a land-office business ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I highly recommend a visit to the cocktail lounge side of the Lone Eagle, at the very least.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Try the lobster bisque...it was some of the best we'd ever had.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We didn't have many of our meals at the hotel, but what food we did have was good and fairly priced.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In addition to the appetizers we enjoyed at the Lone Eagle, we also had lunch and drinks at Cutthroat's Saloon ( right off the lobby ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's one of those Old West throw-your-peanut-shells-on-the-floor places.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"it was fun and relaxed, bartenders were great ( thanks, Jeff! ), and both food and beverages were delicious and priced right.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A Cosmopolitan martini was $ 5 at Cutthroat's, as opposed to $ 7.50 at Lone Eagle ( and was quite a bit larger ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of the Hyatt's many amenities is a large, beautiful casino right off the hotel lobby which drew an attractive, substantial crowd the weekend we were there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One word of caution, though...the slots are EXTREMELY tight at the Hyatt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You will very easily run through a $ 20 on a quarter slot machine in less than 10 minutes in that casino ( this is betting one credit at a time ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would like to add that I fully expect to lose everything I put into a slot machine, but I would like to get a little entertainment bang for my buck while doing so.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We drove about 5 miles to the west to Jim Kelly's Nugget Casino one night ( right on the CA/NV border ) and I played for 45 minutes with one $ 20.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They boast slots that are\" 23 % looser\" according to Nevada gambling statistics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Based upon my personal experience, it certainly seemed to be the case.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This resort also offers a beautiful new spa on-site with almost any treatment imaginable....from every type of massage, to hair styling, to nails, to skincare.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They also have a sauna, as well as a large jacuzzi and heated pool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My husband enjoyed an 80 minute Sierra Stone Massage while we were there, and practically had to be poured back into the room afterward.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The special services are not inexpensive, but neither are they outrageous...and they are performed in a lovely, relaxing, professional environment.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Hyatt is located on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe, which is the quieter side of the lake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are plenty of of places to ski all around the lake, and all are relatively centrally located to the resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You probably won't drive more than 25 miles in either direction to reach the furthermost ski destination you could possibly choose...and the drive is spectacular whichever way you travel.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are more casinos on the South Shore ( and it is also more congested and touristy ), but having stayed on both sides, I prefer the more quaint and low-key North Shore.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Two restaurant recommendations before I wrap up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you visit Lake Tahoe, try The Blue Agave on the NW side of the lake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They serve up some of the freshest, tastiest Mexican food my husband and I have ever eaten ( and he used to live in Mexico! ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is a lovely restaurant with a beautiful view of the lake, and is quite inexpensive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a memorable dining experience when money

trips to Vegas, this was my best hotel experience yet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Treasure Island is excellent for a number of reasons, with location being a top bonus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Treasure Islands location allows easy access to the strip, and the convenient tram to the Mirage saves time and sun exposure.","target":"Genuine

hotels, with NYNY and MGM being prime examples, the guest elevators are obscured in the midst of the casino.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At Treasure Island, it is a straight shot from the door to the guest elevators.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Room","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Treasure Island boasts its spectacular views of the Pirate Battle or the

and poolside service are readily available.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My main complaint about the pool is that to get to it, guests must walk through the main part of the hotel shopping area, and right past the Mystere theatre.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That is not the most comfortable stroll to take when you are dripping wet and unkempt.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I did not try any of the spa services offered at Treasure Island, but they had a nice selection of massages, facials, manicures, etc. available for guests.","target":"Genuine

little brother to Disney World.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As a child, I had never been there, and my parents could nt find it in their budget to take Danny there either.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I told him that when I graduated college, he and I would hop on a plane and spend a week with the Mouse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course, I did nt realize it would cost so much money!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As a recent college graduate, I wanted to cut costs wherever I could.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Furthermore, I wanted to take good care of my then-10-year-old brother, and ultimately, I wanted to stay on property.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After a tremendous deal of research, dozens of travel agent interviews, and about 24 paychecks, I made our reservations at the Wilderness Lodge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This all seemed well and good to me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Wed be on property; wed get early admission into the parks; the cost was reasonable; and wed have a great time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But then I received a letter from the good people at the Disney Corporation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seemed they had me in their database of Meeting Planners, and as a result, they wanted to impress me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was just starting to get accustomed to this star treatment, which was a perk to my underpaid job.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Without question, I took them up on their offer and called their convention office.","target":"Genuine

","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could hardly believe it!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anywhere?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could stay anywhere?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How about the Grand Floridian?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":" Well, Shannon, of course you can stay at the Grand Floridian if that s what you really want.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But why dont you try The Disney Yacht and Beach Club?  Thats all I needed to hear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Disneys Yacht and Beach Club is indeed two separate hotels; however, they are one resort ( Does that make sense? ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The two properties share restaurants, convention services, and a large, spectacular pool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, when you make your reservations, you do need to specify whether youd like to be in the Yacht Club or the Beach Club.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both hotels are magnificent, offering large, beautiful rooms; first-class service; a beautiful view; a lovely beach; and the shortest possible route to Epcot Center.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I place this review under The Beach Club, because that s where I ended up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My brother and I stayed in a first-floor suite, which had a separate back patio.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The patio looked out over a small, private pool, which got little use during our stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room was large, clean, and carefully decorated.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It offered a full marble bath, two telephones, fax/modem capabilities, concierge services, and a lovely view.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With that said, we did nt plan to spend a heck of a lot of time in our upgraded room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were the first to arrive at the parks in the morning, and we were the last to leave at night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We did, however, make good use of the restaurants, the Beach Club Water Park, the room service, the concierge, and mostly, the location.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Situated right next to Epcot Center, you can walk from the Beach Resort to a back gate into Epcot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The luxury of using the back gate is that you avoid any long lines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After spending an entire day at this modern theme park, we simply skipped back over to the hotel, where we recharged our batteries for the next day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The following morning, we caught a van to The Magic Kingdom, where we were granted early admission.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That evening, we attended the Hawaiian Luau.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To get there, we took the van to the Magic Kingdom, then hopped on the Monorail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Likewise, when we went to MGM, we also took the van.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I should note that the Monorail does not make stops at The Disney Beach and Yacht Club, because it is a little off the beaten path.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, there was never a lack of alternate transportation, and we never had to wait for these services.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Beach Club Water Park was most definitely a highlight of our trip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rather than simply supplying a large pool, this water park offers slides, beaches, games, and a very large play area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Surprisingly, it was never crowded, and as a result, we skipped Orlandos other water park attractions.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In the end, this saved me a lot of dough.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You see, there is no admission cost to relax at the Beach Club Water Park; it is included in the price of your hotel reservations.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We also took advantage of the property restaurants, which offered a character breakfast as well as an all-you-can-eat dinner buffet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In classic Disney style, the food was delicious and plentiful; the waiters were undeniably friendly and cordial; and the atmosphere was fun, relaxed, and upscale.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Beach Club property, in one word, is magnificent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since then, I have had the pleasure of staying at just about all the Disney hotels, and this one beats the competition hands-down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Does it compare to the Grand Floridian?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You bet!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only thing the Floridian has over this property is a coveted stop on the Monorail track.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other than that, you will get the same upscale service and a fabulous view.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Likewise, in my opinion, the Beach Club is a bit more laid-back, and it never seems quite as crowded.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Staying at the Disney Beach and Yacht Club comes at a price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is one of Disneys more expensive properties, as well it should be.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But within walking distance, you can enjoy the new boardwalk; the large, lake-view beach; and an easy stroll to Epcot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition, this is a first-class property, which rivals any Ritz.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When my convention sales associate advised me to stay at the Disney Beach and Yacht Club, she ( in effect ) admitted that this is their proudest accomplishment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you have a little extra money and you are seeking an unforgettable trip to Disney World, this is my # 1 suggestion for a place to rest your weary feet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In conclusion, Danny and I enjoyed a fabulous vacation at Disney World.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of all the places Ive visited in my lifetime, this was by far my most magical adventure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Disney will never be the same for me as it was that year.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It was my first time, and my little brother is not so little anymore.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Sometimes, now, when I look at his broad shoulders and baby soft facial hair; when I hear his deep, intelligent voice; when I watch him pull out of my moms driveway  I see a tired little boy dressed in mouse ears, waving flags on Main Street, collecting character autographs, and wildly giggling at the top of his ten-year-old lungs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I ache for that vacation all over again ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Right next to the Yacht Club at Walt Disney World is the Beach Club Resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although many think the two hotels are identical, they are in fact, very different.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you read my Yacht Club review, you know that I love staying at that resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I have also stayed at the Beach Club a few times and have enjoyed my stay here as much as on the other side!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Location: The Beach Club resort is right in the middle of EPCOT and MGM Studios.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's actually walking distance to both theme parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This can be really convenient because if you go out to the front of the resort where the Disney busses pick you up ( free transportation to anywhere on Disney property ), and it seems crowded, you can either take a left or right ( depending on which park you are heading to ) and take a scenic walk to the gates.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Beach Club is also within a few minutes of almost all other places on property, including Disney Village, Typhoon Lagoon, Fantasia Golf, and the Boardwalk.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Rooms: With 583 guest rooms, there are 4 different types of rooms to choose from:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"#NAME?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"-Standard View/2 Queens/Kings - view of garden of parking lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"-Water, Pool View/2 Queens/Kings - view of pool or lake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"#NAME?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've stayed in two different rooms at the Beach Club.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One was a standard room with a\"view\" of the parking lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The second was a suite, which also had a view of the parking lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both rooms were very alike, except that the suite was bigger and had a smaller balcony.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both of the rooms had 2 Queen size beds which were pretty comfortable and a television facing the beds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was a futon in the rooms as well, which was nice because we travel with 5 people and that gives the fifth person a place to sleep!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A Table and chairs were in the corner of the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Next to the closet, there was a dresser and across from the closet is the bathroom area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Two sinks were right outside of the bathroom and the shower and toilet were on the inside.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was funny to find a telephone and television speakers inside of the bathroom too!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, of course, it was nice to listen to the news while you're taking a shower!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Every morning at the Beach Club, a paper is delivered right outside your door.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Atmosphere: The Beach Club is just beautiful!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On both sides of the lobby, there are cushioned seats around beautiful flowers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you feel like relaxing indoors, you can sit down in one of the comfortable chairs or couches in the lobby.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you go outside, you will find rocking chairs and some beautiful topiary pieces.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The last time I was there, there was a huge butterfly as soon as you walk out of the lobby.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just across the Boardwalk is the beach and the lagoon, where you can sit on a swing and enjoy the beautiful day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Pool: Known as the most popular pool on Disney property, The Beach Club's pool is just GREAT!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pool is shared with the Yacht Club, which is adjacent to the Beach Club.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are actually 3 different pools in this area and they are all different so everyone can enjoy them!.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first pool that you see when you walk out of the Beach is Stormalong Bay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A huge water slide emties into the pool whose entrance is right across the Boardwalk.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But Stormalong Bay doesn't only have a water slide!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also has a whirlpool,\"quicksand\" and one spot where you can swim into a huge pool of bubbles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you cross over to the next pool, you will feel the current pull you along.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a lazy river pool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The next pool is a children's pool, where the water is shallow and the kids can build sandcastle's on the sandy beach area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These pools are so different from all the other pools on property because there is sand on the bottom of them!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hot tubs are located in the middle of Beaches and Cream and Stormalong bay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are a couple quiet pools that you can also go to, which are open really late at night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Food: Whether you're looking for a quick snack or a sit-down dinner, the Beach Club has it all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Out by the pool is Hurricane Hanna's where you can get alcoholic beverages, hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken fingers and cookies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Poolside beverage service is available all day from Hurricane Hanna's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Beaches and Cream Soda Shop is just a couple minutes away.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This restaurant is great because it looks like an old soda fountain shop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here, they offer meals, like turkey club sandwiches or hamburgers or you can just order some ice cream to go.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are looking for a full-service restaurant, then you should try the Cape May Caf.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Every morning, the buffet restaurant has a Character breakfast with Goofy, Chip and Dale, and Minnie Mouse.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Every night, an indoor clambake buffet offers clams, mussels, beef-ribs, chicken and some great desserts!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Marthas Vineyard is located inside and has a different selections from different vineyards.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Rip Tide is a lobby lounge that has wines, wine coolers, beers, cocktails, and frozen drinks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only thing I don't like about the Beach Club's food is that there isn't a food court, not even

New England sailing theme; the Beach Club is themed more like a seaside retreat, decorated in pale, refreshing\"beachy\" colors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pool, called Stormalong

burgers, tuna sandwiches, etc. and drinks ( alcoholic and non ) to eat on the patio or take back to your poolside chair.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over at the Yacht Club, you might

to the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, and you can take a scenic walk to EPCOT Center ( entering through the World Showcase...only a 5-minute walk, if that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Bonus: you can see France from certain spots at the resort!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"; ) ) You can also take a boat launch to EPCOT.","target":"Genuine

Contemporary, Polynesian ), park there, and take the monorail to the Magic Kingdom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Likewise for the Animal Kingdom--park at the new Animal Kingdom Lodge, or simply drive to the park itself to save a LOT of time that might be spent on an uncomfortable bus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, Disney's Beach Club knows how to make a good time

seemed to be somewhat lacking.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The rooms themselves are mainly in two wings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We asked for and received a room on the 5th floor overlooking the Magic Kingdom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The plus was having a view of the Castle and viewing the fireworks at night through the trees.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The minus is that this overlooks the smokehouse for the restaurant and a delivery area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some people have said they found it noisy, but we didn't notice any outside noise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 5th floor balconies have a railing, while the 6th floor has decorative boards, making it harder for little ones to get a view and tempting them to climb up to get one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room was nicely decorated and clean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The double sink is outside of the bathroom and has plenty of counter space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was also quite a bit of closet space.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of the amenities the deluxe resorts have over moderates is a full room service instead of pizza delivery, Though we never used it, the menu was very tempting and would've been nice for a late-night snack after a day of touring the parks.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Another amenity is the\" Cubs Den\" where your children can go for fun at night while the parents get a night out to themselves.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We don't like to leave our kids on vacation, but I have heard from a lot of people that their kids look forward to spending this time away from Mom and Dad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But what we loved best about the Wilderness Lodge was the pool area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Water runs out of the lobby and down through a waterfall and a\"brook\" into the pool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a slide that my 9 year old couldn't get enough of.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even in the cool early March nights, the two of them would ask to go to the pool after a day in the parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is also a wading pool for little swimmers and two hot tubs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In keeping with the Northwest theme, a geyser goes off every hour.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of this area offers a clear view of Bay Lake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our daughters had their hair\"wrapped\" poolside at a cost of about $ 60 for the two of them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you can get out of doing this, it's a good idea.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We started the tradition one year and now they look forward to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Magic Kingdom is just a short boat ride away from Wilderness Lodge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is also a marina, and you can watch the water pageant on the beach every night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This resort is so interesting that Disney offers tours.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Inquire at guest services if you are interested.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is one of the resorts I would love to stay at again if I had the money cause we enjoyed it so much.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Just spent the weekend at the Golden Nugget.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was really a bit frightened that it would be, well, stinky.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have been in the downtown Fremont area before (usually late night taxi rides from the Strip )... but had never stayed at any of the hotels there.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was quite pleasantly surprised!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was absolutely gorgeous.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly, the rooms were nicely sized and very affordable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our biggest bonus ( and still not sure why this happened ), was upon check-in the gal informed us we had a $ 50 credit to be used anywhere in the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have no idea why, it may have been because we booked the rooms through www.tripreservations.com,","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"but anyway - we did not argue.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This was a great treat because it allowed us room service twice, tip included!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I must say the room service food was excellent, top notch, with prompt delivery.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We also ate at the Carson Street cafe and the food there was very good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only thing that might scare someone off, especially someone new to Vegas who might not know what to expect - is that the hotels and streets surrounding the Nugget can be a bit seedy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You might see a few more drunks, street vagrants and hookers than you would see at say, Caesar's Palace!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They certainly have cleaned it up well with the Fremont Street Experience, a giant dome was built over the street that has a light show every night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This has drawn a few more family types down to the area, but while you may be watching the light show with your wife - you just might get cat-called by one of the strippers canvasing the crowd in front of Glitter Gulch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I will also say, steer clear of\" Mermaids\" a small, stinky, machine only mini casino with the cheapest liquor in tiny cups ( they do not pour anything but flat tap beer and disgusting well liquor ) and some of the scariest Coney Dogs with faux nacho cheese sauce I have ever seen.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It used to be a tostada bar, not bad then.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This place is a design nightmare, if you do go ( maybe you like design nightmares ) check out the costumes on the mermaid/Carmen Miranda girls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What are they?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not too far of a walk to the Golden Gate Hotel, established in 1906, with 99-cent shrimp cocktails that rock!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You will have to stand in a bit of a line, with mostly cranky people, but 99 cent shrimp cocktails are okay by me!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All in all we had a really great stay at the Golden Nugget.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would definitely stay

quiet, relaxing place to stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hotel/Resort Ambience","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Golden Nugget, though it lacks the theme-orientation and

and a mural-sized original oil painting by LeRoy Neiman.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The decor is rather generic but pleasing, with red/black carpeting, pure white walls and lots of beautifully maintained polished brass accents.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The pool has a large and fully equipped spa and exercise facility, a beautiful outdoor pool area, and, of course, a vast casino.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its Carson Street cafe serves excellent\" coffee shop\" food, their buffet is excellent and reasonably priced, and there are three

for men and women as well as the usual novelty gifts and snacks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are no other shops at the Nugget.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One of the main draws of the Nugget is that it is an ADULT environment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because there are no attractions for children, you won't find them wandering through the

obtrusive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cocktail waitresses circulate frequently offering free beverages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Casino employees are friendly and helpful, for the most part.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's a pleasant place to gamble, though I usually go elsewhere, since single-deck blackjack favors the player.","target":"Genuine

other casinos downtown and its outstanding quality for money spent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rates are modest by Vegas standards, given the luxury of this resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once you stay at the Golden Nugget several times, you are invited to join their\" Private Arrangement\" club, where discounts and freebies are offered to frequent

accrued.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's tough to pass up a good deal like this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Golden Nugget has been a mainstay of Las Vegas, and even by current Strip standards, is a prime place to stay and play.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The new owners are committed to retain the high standards set by Steve Wynn, and are constantly upgrading and remodelling to remain competitive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's a jewel that is worth many times its modest price.","target":"Genuine

and is on the pricier side ( haven't been there, but have seen the menu ), The Buffet is decent, but there's almost always a huge line - Golden Nugget is famous for their bread pudding (ick ), which I don't like but other people rave about and the prices are reasonable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Coffee Shop ( can't remember the name ) is very good, usually not too bad a wait if you go at off hours.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They have the best french toast I have ever eaten - The Nugget French Toast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's Hawaiian

like to gamble at the Golden Gate ( when I'm feeling cheap ) because they have $ 3 tables.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, the laser show on Fremont Street is really incredible - they have it every evening after dark.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are little kiosks with gifts, etc... up and down the street too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However,

negative"},{"sentence":"Overall","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As I mentioned earlier we were there 25 years ago and liked it so much we went back for our 25th anniversary.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If everything goes well well go back again for another occasion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I only hope that this time it will not be 25 more years.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its a great place for the entire family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everyone is treated like they are the most important people there by all the staff.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You are greeted with Aloha!  by all the staff.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Every question is answered in a quick and efficient manner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want reservations to a show or dinner they make you feel like they really want to make them for you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of all the places Ive stayed over the years, Disneys Polynesian Resort is the best!!!!!!!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have recently returned from my honeymoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My husband and I chose Disney World for several reasons.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To begin with, I grew up in California, so my family always went to Disney Land.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, we had cable television and I remember watching a special on all the different theme hotels at Disney World and wishing I could stay at all the different hotels.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had stayed with my family at the Disneyland hotel many times, but that hotel does not have a theme.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Our first choice was the Grand Floridian, but since we were paying for the honeymoon ourselves, we opted not to stay there after learning that our honeymoon would cost about $ 500 more than it would if we stayed at the Polynesian.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The\" Poly\" was our second choice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We chose to stay there because it had a Hawaiian/Polynesian theme that would be ( hopefully ) similar to going to Hawaii for a honeymoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, not exactlybut you know what I mean.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Poly is very ideally situated.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is on the monorail line, so getting to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot are very easy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is also within walking distance of the Ticket and Transportation Center, which provides bus transportation to MGM Studios, Animal Kingdom, Downtown Disney and the water parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Additionally, bus transportation is also provided directly from the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Staying at the Poly makes it very easy to get around the\" World.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms at the Poly are quite large.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rooms are located in one of about five or six 2-3 story buildings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A standard room comes with two queen beds and a day bed, so two parents and three children can stay quite comfortably.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think you can fit in a baby in a crib in addition to the five people already staying there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The armoire has 5 drawers or so with plenty of space for clothes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Additionally, there is a large closet with a room safe for storing valuables.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is also a table, two chairs and an ice bucket.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room dcor is very festive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Island patterned bedspreads about and the aforementioned armoire had a faux bamboo design as did the headboard.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While it was more kitschy than authentic, it was still a fun place to stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are several types of rooms.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The least expensive is the\"garden\" room and there are also\"lagoon\" rooms ( with views of the water ) and concierge rooms with lots of extra pampering.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had a garden room-next to the monorail, no less.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, even though the monorail passed right by our patio door, it was so quiet that it did not bother us at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Great Ceremonial house is the main building at the Poly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It includes clothing stores for men and women.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We got caught in a HUGE rainstorm on Wednesday and Steve's shorts were soaked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We thought about buying another pair for him, but the shorts on sale were around $ 40-and they were ugly!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of our favorite places was the snack bar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can buy a mug there for $ 10 and then get free refills for the duration of your stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Considering that a soda costs about $ 1.50, this is a great cost saver-especially if you come back to the hotel for a rest in the middle of the afternoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Additional dining options include the Kona Caf and Ohanas, which we ate at on our first night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I plan to review the restaurant in a different section, but I assure you, this is a must see-even if you don't stay at the Poly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In short, it is an all-you can eat feast featuring meat on sticks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cost is $ 22 per person and well worth it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's a great place to take kids-we loved our meal there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the morning, Ohanas features a character breakfast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is also a luau show presented two or three times a night for several nights a week, but we did not see it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Poly features a\"quiet\" pool and the more popular\" Volcano\" pool with a water slide and\" smoking\" volcano.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since we went in August and it was very hot just about every day, the pools were crowded.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The waterslide was fun, but ruffian children going down face first made it a little less fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although we did not do this, the Poly also rents little speedboats for about $ 25 for a  hour.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They looked like a lot of fun, but we did not have time to do this.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I did have a couple of very minor problems about the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, the shower pressure was very low.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know if this was a Florida drought thing or something else, but it was annoying.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, our remote control had no batteries, but since we did not spend so much time watching television, this did not bother us either.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The pillows were smaller than normal and a little hard, but that was the only thing that bothered me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As you can see, these things are minor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, when we arrived, Steve asked about an room upgrade because it was our honeymoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The clerk said that there were no rooms available, but he would be happy to send something for us over the next day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We never got anything.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Again, since we were going to be getting something for nothing, not getting it didn't bother me, but still.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Overall, staying at the Poly was great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We ate a meal at the Yacht Club resort and we found it somewhat inconvenient to take a crowded bus to and from the Magic Kingdom after our own experiences of simply taking the monorail to the Magic Kingdom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In my opinion, it is worth the money to be so close to the theme parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Poly is a great place for everyone-honeymooners, couples, families, singles-everyone can appreciate the dcor and everything the Poly has to offer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've been to Walt Disney World about nine times since 1985 and stayed at the Polynesian Beach Resort most of those times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first time was an accident ( it was all that was available ) but each time afterward it was a conscious decision.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've talked to numerous people at the resort who told me that, they too were repeat visitors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That in itself might be sufficient endorsement, but I'll elaborate:-)","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Location","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In real estate, they say that location is everything.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If that's the case, you can't go wrong here if your main interest at WDW is the Magic Kingdom.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Like the Contemporary, Grand Floridian and Wilderness Lodge, the Polynesian is located across the water from the MK.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unlike the others, though, you have four options for getting there from the Poly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can take the monorail from the station within the resort ( about five minutes, depending on timing ); take the boat from the Poly marina dock ( about ten minutes, longer if the circular route takes you to the Grand Floridian first ); or walk over to the Ticket and Transportation Center and take the ferryboat or direct monorail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The last two options may not sound too appealing, but if you're on the west side of the resort, the walk is less than ten minutes and if there is a big line at the Poly, you might save some time.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"More importantly, here's something few people don't realize -- by walking to the TTC, you can get on a direct monorail to EPCOT and save yourself the trip around the lagoon on the resort monorail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This makes the Polynesian the only resort with direct monorail access to two theme parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All over locations within Walt Disney World are accessed by Disney bus ( or your car ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rooms","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The standard room at the Polynesian is very large.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are two Queen sized beds and a day bed -- enough space for five adults.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bathroom is fairly sizable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The South Seas theming is carried into the rooms with canopies over the beds, cane furniture and appropriate coloured wallpaper and paint.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One complaint that I have about the rooms is that there aren't enough power outlets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bring a computer, camcorder and cellular phone on trips and have a hard time plugging everything in without putting something in the bathroom ( not a good idea ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can connect to AOL with a local call ( 0.75 charge per call ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms are spread around the resort in various\"longhouses\" ( traditional Polynesian structures ) that are three stories high.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some of the older buildings do not have balconies on the second floor.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If getting a balcony ( first floor rooms all have patios ) is important to you, be sure to call the resort a couple of days before you arrive to request it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because of the layout of the resort, some buildings are lengthy hikes away from the main building.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My personal favourites are Samoa and Fiji, both of which are near the main building.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want to be further away ( and quieter ), the Tahiti is on the far end of the resort ( and has a short walk to the TTC. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of the rooms have recently been refurbished.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Food Service","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are two full service restaurants at the hotel and a 24 hour snack bar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"O'Hana","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"O'Hana, which means\"family\", serves two meals.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a character breakfast with ( last time I was there ) Minnie, Goofy and Chip and Dale.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The food is all you can eat, family style and is no better or worse than you'd find at the local Perkins.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is also an evening meal (\"feast\" ) that consists of appetizers, a salad, all the\"skewer served roasted meat\" you can handle, and a pineapple and caramel desert.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm of the opinion that the evening meal has declined over the years and, while I used to love it, I now generally skip it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On nights when there are fireworks over the Magic Kingdom, they dim the lights and pipe in the music so that you can enjoy it from the huge windows that overlook the lagoon and MK.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Kona Cafe","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This replaced the Coral Island Cafe, which was awful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've only eaten here a couple of times and the food, island in nature, is much better, but very overpriced.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not too bad for lunch, but don't go there if you are in a hurry.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Captain Cooks","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a snack bar on the lower level of the main building.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's open 24 hours ( and occasionally puts out 1/2 price pastries after 1am:-) and serves some hot food ( burgers, chicken sandwiches and hot dogs ) along with pastries and ice creams.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first night you are there, buy a refillable mug.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can go back to the snack bar for the duration of your stay and refill it with soda, lemonade and coffee for free.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nothing at Captain Cooks is overly bad or overly good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's just convenient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Amenities","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is plenty to do at the resort that has nothing to do with the theme parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can rent paddle or mini speed boats, and sail boats (you apparently need some sort of proof that you know how to sail to get on those ) to check out the Seven Seas Lagoon and Bay Lake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are several white sand beachs with chairs and umbrellas.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Swimming in the Lagoon is not encouraged.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are two pools.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One is currently ( 2/01 ) closed for renovation, and is a themed pool (eg: lots of kids ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other is a\"quiet pool\" and is just a big round thing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both pools are heated and may be swum in during the coldest weather.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once or twice the pools have been closed in the evening due to mosquito problems.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Otherwise, they are open all night, but only supervised with lifeguards until about 10pm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you go to the Great Ceremonial House ( main building ) during the day, there are often activities for children, including Disney movies, colouring and singing and dancing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also within the main building there are several stores, offering clothing ( pretty pricey, ) tropical items and sundries.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a pub and small liquor off sale in the main building as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Suggestions","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Book a garden view room and ask when you check in if they have any upgrades available.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've been bumped up a couple of times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rent a car.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The bus system, while efficient, will never get you where you need to go as fast as driving yourself.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Don't forget the short walk to the TTC if you want to go to EPCOT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It will save you a ton of time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can take the resort monorail back to the Polynesian on your return -- it's the first stop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For a quiet evening, grab a couple of drinks and go down to the beach about 9pm to watch the Electrical Water Pageant, an underpublicized and enjoyable event.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Drop your kids off at the Neverland Club ( located within the resort ) and spend an evening at Pleasure Island.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Neverland Club, like Ohana, has deteriorated a bit over the years, but is still fun for little kids.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is an expensive resort, no doubt about that.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Going during the off season and joining the Disney Club will result in some reductions, but it's still not a place to go if you're on a tight budget.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"To start off my review, let me put it quite simply:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"WILDERNESS LODGE IS A FABULOUS PLACE TO STAY AT ON YOUR DISNEY WORLD VACATION.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now, to expound on that a bit more....","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"***RESORT LOBBY, RESTAURANTS, and AMENITIES***","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My family and I vacationed in WDW last in Sept. 2001 and had the opportunity to stay for the week in this gorgeously themed and decorated resort and were highly impressed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The\" Disney magic\" is abundantly felt and seen in this huge log cabin of a resort, a resort made up in the style of old American Northwest Woods cabin.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you're not already in awe at the sight of this impressive building, you're really in for a treat once you walk through the front doors into the enormous, open lobby.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It really will take your breath away as within the lobby is a huge multi-colored stone fireplace, a huge wooden totem pole made of various animal carvings, and hanging from the ceiling as lights are large Native American tents with various hunting depictions on them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the background, playing fairly lightly are tunes from various western films such as Dances With Wolves, which if you've heard the songs from it, are beautiful and tranquil to listen to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Off to the right as you walk into the building is the Service Desk, where resort employees are available at all times to offer prompt and courteous service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have to give credit to the help, since we made use of them several times and they never came off as being bothered by your questions and were genuinely interested in helping you.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That may be a pretty small thing for some people, but that small thing adds to the overall charm and appeal of WL.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Within the main lobby are several small sitting places with comfortable chairs and sofas.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We took advantage of these numerous times so we could all play cards.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was convenient, and we managed to be friendly with the other guests who usually stopped by out of curiosity to see what we were doing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To the left and going down the ramp are the resorts main eating establishments, Artist Point ( the fancier, more expensive dinner-only restaurant which serves American cuisine and requires you to make advance reservations ), Whispering Canyon Cafe ( the more moderately priced family restaurant serving all three meals and occasionally has a visit by a Disney character during breakfast ), and The Roaring Forks snack bar ( a quick and easy counter-service area that serves up light snacks and meal items any time of the day ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you don't make the turn down to the Roaring Forks and continue outside, you're in the pool area of the resort.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The main pool is heated, but on the small side.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a waterslide for kids of all ages to take advantage of as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's also a kiddie pool and 2 hot tubs for you to use when not crowded already.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There's a path that leads out to the dock where you can take the ferry to the Magic Kingdom or over to Fort Wilderness.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Set among a number of weeping willow trees, walking along here adds to the rustic feel of the atmosphere felt all over the Wilderness Lodge Resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you're back in the lobby facing the Service Desk, there's another walkway to the left of it, leading to, among other things, the bus stop from which you can make your way to the theme parks, other resorts, or anything else within Disney property.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, along this way is the resort arcade, containing a number of video games for the children, and the Wilderness Lodge Mercantile, a general store of sorts from which you can purchase snacks, shirts, toys, or personal supplies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( QUICK TIP ) - I found on my last visit that some of the same snack items can be found both in the Roaring Forks eatery as well as in the Wilderness Lodge Mercantile, in some cases cheaper in one of these spots or the other.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm not sure why, but on several items I found this to be the case.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You may want to check before you decide to get some snacks from either spot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"***ROOMS***","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms are pretty straightforward hotel rooms: beds (queen size, king size, bunk, or whichever you reserve your room with ), table, chairs, drawers, small fridge, small TV, sink area outside toilet and shower room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My only real complaint about the room is that it was pretty small with few extras for the price we were paying for it per day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, the beds take up most of the width of the room and the corners of the beds only come up so far so that it's really easy to bump your shin on it while walking through the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can't even remember how many bruises I ended up having on my leg from hitting against the corner of the bed.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There's also a small balcony and depending on what you're willing to pay for the room, you get either a view of the woods that hide the resort from the road, or you get a beautiful view overlooking the pool area and Bay Lake.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would prefer this view if only for the nightly view of the Electric Water Pageant that makes its way around the lake displaying some brightly colored light pictures while music plays.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"***ROOM RATES***","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are 4 main time periods, or seasons, during which the room rates vary.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Disney calls them\" Value\",\" Peak\",\" Regular\", and\" Holiday\" time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Believe me, you want to be sure of which time period your vacation falls into because you could either be paying ( according to 2002 prices ) $ 194 per night or upwards of $ 309.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are a number of Internet websites, including Disney's own, that will give you the exact time frame for each season and some that can provide you instructions for calling and getting some pretty good discounts on resort rooms.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example, check out www.mousesavers.com","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"and you'll see what I mean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"***TRANSPORTATION***","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As mentioned earlier, there's a dock for the ferry and there's a bus-stop in front of the resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These are the main two means of getting to whereever you wish to go in Disney World.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, the resort is too far out to be included on the monorail line, but that's a minor quibble of mine because I enjoy riding along Disney's monorail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ferry ride is very relaxing, especially on a beautifully sunny, cloudless day, either when going to or coming from a day at the Magic Kingdom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Disney buses run pretty regularly, every 20 minutes or so, so you'll always have a way to get around, unless you have your own car or a rental.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had a minor complaint on the last visit with the buses not quite being on time.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I believe on several occasions we ended up waiting there nearly 30 minutes which is pretty aggravating for those already impatient in wanting to get to the parks and on those rides.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"***FINAL THOUGHTS***","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had a truly great time during my stay at the Wilderness Lodge, I really did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not many may take the time to check out the resort because they're so busy wanting to see and do everything they can in Disney World, but I advise you as a potential future guest to walk through it and see what you can.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"From the moment you set foot through the door, you get a very cozy, inviting, warm feeling from the place and that feeling lasts the entire length of your stay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The service is great, you get a good night's rest, and as a resort guest are also treated to free refills on coffee after your initial purchase of a resort mug.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Wilderness Lodge is an extremely well-done Disney resort, very relaxing, a treat to stay at, and you're guaranteed to have a great time in an already great vacation destination.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you have never stayed at a Disney resort prepared to be wowed by the Wilderness Lodge.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The themes are carried to the hilt and the service is unbelievable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have only been to Disney twice but we have stayed at the lodge both times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"During our visit this September our daughter came down with a 102.4 degree fever.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I was freaking out about being stuck at the resort without a vehicle, the resort managers arranged to have Judy, a wonderfully friendly front desk clerk, drive us the full twenty minutes to After Hours Pediatrics.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She also came to pick us up when when we were ready.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The next morning a personalized, autographed picture of the Little Mermaid was slid under our door wishing that Emily would feel well enough to come visit in person.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Needless to say, the service and amenities far exceeded my expectations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The children are truly the guest at Disney and they are treated as specially as the paying adults are treated.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While you should prepare to spend a pretty penny to stay in the park, the service and convenience make it worth it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only are you able to purchase the Ultimate Park Hopper ticket (unavailable to those not staying on site ), you are right in the middle of the action, you dont have to fight traffic, and you are able to make it back to your room in about 15 minutes from anywhere in the Walt Disney World complex.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"While I have nt stayed in other Disney resorts, this hotel is described by the cast members as the frequent guests  favorite.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The lodge is booked when other resorts are bare.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Prepared to be impressed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Logistics","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Wilderness Lodge is one of what are sometimes called the\" Magic Kingdom Resorts\" at Walt Disney World.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is considered one of the deluxe resorts which means it is a little more expensive than most of the other Disney Resorts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is located in close proximity to the Magic Kingdom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the resort is not on the monorail line, you can hop on a boat to the Magic Kingdom or take a bus to anywhere else on Disney property.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We took a towncar from the airport and did not have a car the whole trip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Aside from the unexpected illness, we would never have needed a vehicle.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Disney provides great access to transportation and every cast member is ready to provide detailed directions and tips for getting to your desired destination quickly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is This Really Florida?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The resort itself is modeled after a lodge that you might find in one of the country's national parks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you first enter the lodge you immediately notice the grand openness of the design.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lobby is filled with little seating areas for you to rest your tired feet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are large totem poles and a beautiful 80 foot tall fireplace.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The chandeliers are designed to look like tee pees and there are Indian artifacts in cases throughout the lobby.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Wilderness Lodge also has a small alcove for children to watch a Disney cartoon while Mom and Dad check into the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At the back of the lobby is a wooden bridge that spans a bubbling brook.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It turns into a little stream that flows out of the lobby and appears to flow into the swimming pool outside ( though I doubt it actually does ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are always kids running back and forth over the bridge they can't resist!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I love the way the atmosphere makes you feel relaxed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I felt like I could lounge in the lobby chairs and not be overly concerned with how fancy my clothes were or whether my daughter was running in circles around the coffee table.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The large service desk is divided into two sections, one for checking in and out and another section for guest services.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It does normally take some time to check into your room since there is more than the normal information to go over.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Cast Members\" often give guests tips to further enjoy the park.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cast members also have\"goody bags\" for children that include some stickers a couple of coloring pamphlets and some crayons.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The guest service desk is typically used to arrange childcare or Priority Seating at resort restaurants after you have checked in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Check in is normally 3:00 pm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, we arrived around noon and our room was available.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is not guaranteed as I did notice other families that were waiting at the pool until their room was ready.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The resort consists of two wings with seven floors and 728 rooms.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The seventh floor is reserved for concierge rooms and is not accessible from the elevator without swiping your room key.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We stayed on the second floor right by the elevator.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While we were there in a typically quiet season, the hallways remained quiet and there always seemed to be an elevator waiting for us when we needed one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are 3 room views available.","target":"Genuine

the room we stayed had two queen size beds with a night stand between them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beds were on wooden frames that lent themselves to frequent toe stubbings but the sheets were soft and the pillows were fluffy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The room was furnished with a wooden table with two chairs as well as a dresser with 3 or four drawers on the bottom and an television cabinet on the top.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of the furniture was very good quality and was decorated with a southwestern/Indian theme.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The colors were a muted turquoise and orange and the wooden furniture was a rich maple color.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lastly, there were sliding glass doors that led to a small balcony.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has a small glass topped table and two all-weather chairs.","target":"Genuine

see yours.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Shopping","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hotel amenities include the usual gift shop with a wilderness theme.","target":"Genuine

food was outstanding.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The prices for breakfast were reasonable, but for dinner expect to pay $ 40-50 for a family of three.","target":"Genuine

pick her up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I am sure some families used the service every night of the week, once was enough for us to enjoy an evening of adult activity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To Sum it Up","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Looking at some of the other reviews I am not the only one to recommend Disney's Wilderness Lodge.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Not only does it allow you to escape everything that is Mickey for at least a while, it makes you feel at home.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is clean, beautiful and the cast members are indulgent and responsive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Disney's Wilderness Lodge is definitely a one-of-a-kind resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Complete with a working geyser and a river that flows through the lobby, this resort is themed as a western lodge.","target":"Genuine

pool, and an awesome waterslide that starts inside a rock.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are paths leading all over so there are many picture taking spots.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The transportation to and from the resort poses a serious problem, however.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The monorail resorts ( Polynesian, Grand Floridian, and Contemporary ) are very convenient because you can just hop on a monorail and go to the Magic Kingdom or EPCOT.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the contrary, here you must wait for a crowded bus to come, sometimes for 20-30 minutes!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is also boat transportation, but that is also slow, and is kind of uncomfortable in the heat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another problem with the resort is the restaurants.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I guess they're just not my style.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Artist's Point Restaurant features mostly fish, and the other restaurant is southern food.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only food we could really eat here

with a big, luscious king-size bed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A fluffy down coverlet on a deliciously inviting bed was more than I could resist.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before even unpacking my bags, I found myself lying on this very comfy bed, looking around a tastefully decorated room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The armoire held a 25 inch television and there was a writing desk, as well as two upholstered chairs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My room had two large windows that were draped in softly muted colors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found myself wishing that my master bedroom at home was as large and comfortably furnished.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A Great Bathroom","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Next on my list to explore was the bathroom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And it certainly did not disappoint.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Italian marble sparkled and large, fluffy towels awaited me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were double sinks with plenty of room for me to stash my necessities.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At times like this I really wish I was a bath person, instead of a shower person.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would probably have enjoyed soaking in a hot bubbly tub and admiring the beautiful surroundings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plenty of Extras","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was a nice large closet, complete with two terry bathrobes, ironing board and iron, as well as extra pillows and blankets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would not be lacking for anything in the room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Overall Elegance","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After admiring my room and finally unpacking, it was time for me to get ready for dinner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had reservations for our group and I wanted a little time before dinner to look around the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sounds of a grand piano drew me toward a beautiful high-ceiling room that looked almost as much like a cathedral as it did a hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was very beautifully and elegantly decorated.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I remember lots of fresh flowers and large paintings and well-dressed people buzzing about.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't want to dawdle too long, staring like a country girl come to town for the first time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But being my usual bumpkinish self I had to take in the atmosphere for a while before following the hallway toward the dining room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dinner for 10, Please","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had a fairly large party ( about 10 of us ) so we were seated at a long table.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The service was excellent and the dinner had been pre-arranged for us with a choice of chicken or beef.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beef medallions were tasty and tender and served with fresh vegetables.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They were preceeded by a crisp salad and fresh bread.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pass the butter, please!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The dining room was elegant, yet not so formal that I felt uncomfortable.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We took our time enjoying our meal and chatting with fellow employees we hadn't seen in a while.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ah, Room Service!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The following day, I had breakfast delivered to my room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( One of the great joys of business travel for me. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was so nice going to the door in my Ritz bathrobe and letting the waiter deliver my food.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm certain I went over my meal allowance but the bacon was crisp, the juice was freshly-squeezed, and the pastries were delicious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My breakfast was promptly and courteously served and most definitely enjoyed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Meeting Facilities","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hotel can accommodate several fairly large meetings in the banquet area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our meeting was held in a large high-ceilinged ballroom, with lovely chandeliers throughout the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The wide hallways and high ceilings were excellent for people milling around without feeling cramped.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There was a very basic lunch served as part of the meeting ( cold sandwiches, chips, and drinks ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As each of the participants had to pay the cost of lunch as part of the attendance fee, they had chosen one of the more economical options.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was certainly nothing like the dinner we had the evening before.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As soon as the meeting ended, I couldn't wait to get back to my room, change clothes and go walk around the Nob Hill area a bit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Very Nice Overall Experience","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had no complaints at all about the Ritz-Carlton during my stay.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The room was comfortable with everything I needed, the food was good, and the service prompt and polite.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As I was only there for two days and busy with a conference I didn't get to check out all the available facilities at the hotel but everything I experienced was excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Ritz Carlton knows how to make you feel special on a day of celebration.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"People of all ages were in the tea room enjoying an afternoon with friends or family, most for a special occasion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was there with my father and some friends, celebrating my birthday.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first thing that struck me was how the staff made their clientele feel absolutely regal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My father had told me to tell them that I was there to meet him\"at the sofa in the corner.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It sounded very cryptic, but as soon as I told the hostess, she nodded knowingly as if my arrival was something they had been waiting for all week!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were seated and our other guests arrived and we each ordered from the tea menu.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were four menus to choose from with prices ranging from $ 21 for the smallest tea to $ 38 for the most luxurious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our group ordered two Full Teas, a Vegetarian Tea, and a Royal Tea.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Beautiful tea sandwiches came in a lovely assortment of Norwegian Smoked Salmon with Pickled Onion and Caviar, Cucumber, Roquefort and Walnuts, Prosciutto and Asparagus Tips, Egg and Chive, and Tomato and Mozarella on Foccacia.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition to the dainty sandwiches, all menus offered sophisticated tea cakes, madeleines, tartlettes, and scones, with a delicious lemon curd and cream.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Royal Tea included a champagne cocktail of choice and a bowl of fresh strawberries and cream.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The menu for the choices of hot tea was two pages long and included some wonderful blends.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was seduced by the sound of China Rose tea and was told that my choice is the most popular at the Ritz Carlton.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Others in my party chose vanilla, which smelled divine, and mint.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No one was disappointed with their choice of tea.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My choice was soothing and indulgent and it was constantly refilled and kept warm for my enjoyment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were surprised that we became full on our afternoon tea.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At first glance of the tea sandwiches, my boyfriend groaned with misery at the thought of remaining hungry for the afternoon, but by the time we were finishing off the pastries, he was refusing another bite.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything is surprisingly filling and can keep you appeased until a late dinner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, I've been told that people are welcome to request additional sandwiches or pastries, but I don't actually know of anyone who has ever tried that.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Personally, I'd feel a bit sheepish!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Service was almost flawless and we were made to feel like royalty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was a wonderful treat for my birthday celebration.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was presented with a surprise plate of strawberries and cream with candles and a happy birthday message drizzled in chocolate on the edge of the plate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was a wonderful alternative to those restaurants where the waiters embarrass you by singing a birthday song and clapping in your face.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My surprise dessert at the Ritz Carlton was wonderfully subtle and allowed the moment to be enjoyed by the people at my table and not the whole room!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The one drawback was that they accidentally brought this surprise to me while my boyfriend was in the bathroom, so we had to wait for him to return with the candle wax spilling all over the cream!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I highly recommend an afternoon tea for a nice celebration or just for taking time to spend a leisurely afternoon with someone, talking and indulging.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I look forward to taking tea more often.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think trips to the Ritz Carlton may not be in my regular schedule, but I am researching slightly less expensive places to take tea in San Francisco.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Please check back as I will surely be reviewing other afternoon teas!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Update May 18, 2001: Took another afternoon tea with Mom for Mother's Day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lovely service as the first time, tea was a little oversteeped.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I did find out that the China Rose Petal tea that I love is made by Taylors of Harrogate, an English tea company.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found that you can order it on http://www.virtualtea.com/","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I highly recommend this tea!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The minute that I pulled up to this hotel, I was awaited by the bell man in their proper blue jackets, welcoming us to one of the greatest cities in the country, San Francisco.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was my first time here, and I knew that staying at the Ritz would certainly not displease me, but the overall stay was much better than what I imagined.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There was so much to do just inside the hotel that it made touring the city seem boring.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First of all, there are many restaurants located throughout the large hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anything from the garden restaurant, to the little lobby restaurant for tea and cookies, to the award winning dining room, voted the best in San Francisco.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Though, beware, look at the prices before you order.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nothing here is cheap, but there is not doubt that it is worth it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After a long day of touring the city, why not go for a swim in the amazing health center?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is an indoor pool, masseuse, and an incredible exercise room fitting all of your needs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then, stop by the concierge to get a recommendation for the best restaurants in town, if you want to leave the hotel of course.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you are not in the mood to leave your room, there are many hit movies to choose from, and room service is exquisite.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Anything from a business trip to a family vacation, The Ritz can make anyone feel satisfied.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This hotel has modern amenities, but still keeps the charm and luxury of historical San Francisco.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is certainly an extraordinary hotel which would make any stay in San Francisco an amazing one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The title of my epinion is a quote from our waiter our very first evening at this beautiful resort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Hyatt Regency Kauai is paradise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've never stayed anywhere else that even comes close to being as nice.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Service","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ordinarily, I'd start off a hotel/resort review with a description the rooms but what makes the Hyatt Regency Kauai unique is the service.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You never are made to feel as if you are an imposition or that all you are valued for is the money in your pockets.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As soon as you drive up to the front entrance, you are greeted by a bellhop who takes your luggage and opens the beautiful double doors for you to enter the lobby.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rest of the lobby is completely open air so I'm not sure if the doors are for show or not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You are given a lei and escorted to the check in desk.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Both times I've stayed here, my basic standard parking lot view room has been upgraded.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We don't spend a lot of time in our room so I don't like to pay for a view.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'll walk outside to see the ocean!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For our first stay, we received a garden view room with a gorgeous view of blooming plumeria trees, multi-colored crotons, birds of paradise and the opportunity to see some weddings take place.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The second time, we received a partial ocean view room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our second stay was a last minute decision as we were traveling with my in-laws.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They had made reservations at the Aston Poipu Kai where our condo was absolutely unacceptable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was filthy, hot and there was a bedspring literally sticking out of the mattress.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I called the Hyatt upon our check-in at the Aston.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They were sold out for that night but found us rooms for the rest of our stay, and at a discounted rate too!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"During one stay, we had some problems with our rental car and even though the automobile company's desk had closed for the evening, the concierge went out of her way to make sure that the rental car company drove out immediately with a replacement car for us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another time, we had scheduled a Na Pali Coast boat tour and we were canceled on three days in a row for various problems ( with more than one company! ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The concierge found us two spots on another company's boat for the last day of our honeymoon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, that too was canceled ( by weather ) but the fact that someone tried very hard to make our vacation special meant a lot to us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rooms","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For both visits, I had a room in the Poipu wing of the hotel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are two wings ( Poipu and Shipwreck ) and each can be a long walk to the lobby area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rooms are very large and each of them has a lamp in the shape of a rooster.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since there are so many roosters running around in the wild on Kauai, it seemed appropriate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Besides the rooster lamp, you'll find a complimentary in-room safe, coffee maker, ceiling fan, large private balcony, hair dryer, marble tubs and sinks and some really nice bath amenities.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The shampoo and conditioner is manufactured by Emlin and is one of the few I've tried that really get your hair squeaky clean after being out in salt water all day without damaging your hair.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We also received a small sample of the Anara Spa's Coco Mango lotion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has the most luxurious scent and is quite addictive.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can order additional lotion directly from the resort spa.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you wish to pay extra or have enough Gold Passport points, you may wish to reserve a Regency Club room which includes complimentary refreshments throughout the day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even if you don't wish to upgrade, be sure to join the Hyatt Gold Passport program ( it's free! ) or give them your membership number.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You'll receive a daily newsletter with all of the resort activities, news clips and some very good recipes to try when you return home.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Be sure to check the number of servings in these recipes so as not to make the mistake I did when baking up some pineapple-coconut muffins.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I ended up with 4 dozen of them!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pools and Landscaping","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything is open air at the resort except for the hallways to the guest rooms.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The landscaping was absolutely breathtaking with flowers everywhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The plumeria were a special favorite and you can smell the flowers in the air everywhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The smell is my absolute favorite thing about the Hyatt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's intoxicating.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of the neatest things about the Hyatt is the use of water.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They have a giant koi pond with what must be at least a hundred fish.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Below that is a bi-level free form freshwater\" action pool\" which includes a water slide, caves and waterfalls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Right below those is a salt water lagoon on a gypsum beach since the regular sand was clogging their filters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the middle of the lagoon is an island with a hammock - if you don't want to swim, there are plenty of hammocks around the lagoon.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We really enjoyed those!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you continue walking, below the saltwater lagoon, you'll find Shipwreck Beach and the Pacific Ocean.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beach is often marked with red flags indicating high surf.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That means don't go in the water!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Many people drown in Hawaii every year when they disregard the warning flags.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also at the beach is a large cliff where we often saw young men jumping into the waves.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It looked scary to me!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A word of caution if you visit: after it rains, the steps and walkways around the pools are extremely slippery.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We didn't have any problems but there probably have been some in the past.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another really neat thing about Hawaii in general is that they don't have thunderstorms or lightning unless there's a hurricane or something terribly out of the ordinary.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is absolutely no need to get out of the water when it rains.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Hyatt is located in the Poipu Beach region of Kauai, which is on the\" sunny\" side of the island.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It really only rained a little bit on the last day and a half of our first stay ( which was in the month of June - our second time was an October visit ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you have any interest in scuba, they have complimentary beginner lessons!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Towels are available by the pool as are wristbands to allow you to ride the water slide.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Resort Activities","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One evening, we attended a video screening in Stevenson's Library ( a bar ) at the Hyatt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This video showed the destruction and power of Hurricane Iniki, which struck the island in September of 1992.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was a terribly sobering video and it really caused us to open our eyes when we were driving around the island.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you look carefully, you can still see some of the effects of this terrible storm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Kauai still hasn't recovered in terms of tourism so the island has a deserted feel to it in many places.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The island only has a full-time population of about 50,000.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The video also recounted how the Hyatt was the only hotel on Kauai to retain all of their employees on the payroll throughout the rebuilding process after Iniki.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hotel was closed for six months!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We know it was a\"propaganda feel good\" video but it really made us respect the employees and the management at the Hyatt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Aside from the videotape, you can play golf, tennis, or billiards, go horseback riding or take advantage of the many Hawaiiana classes they offer ranging from hula dancing to lei making.","target":"Genuine

only element of Cat in the Hat that I found acceptable -- the Seussian visuals.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Flip through any Seuss book and you'll find some of the most colorful,

had fun with the landscape, the houses, the trees, the cars, and everything under the sun ( although, surprisingly, nothing above the sun ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This creative re-engineering draws the viewer ( or reader ) into a parallel universe where age-old lessons can be taught or re-taught without the obstructions created in the minds of this one.","target":"Genuine

isolation.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But this is where the film turns from Seussian into a a blueprint for disaster.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The illustration is just one element in the greater scheme.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To think of Dr. Seuss' work as mere pictures, rhymes and morals is to insult his legacy.","target":"Genuine

slightly longer than this review into a 1 hour and 15 minute feature length film.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This leads to Bo Grinch's biggest mistake, allowing Mike Myers to run willy-nilly through the minds and hearts of the audience in the guise of the Cat in the Hat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seemed to me that Myers forgot that he isn't on Saturday

as this mean, controlling mother was a little too much.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Kirsten Dunsts performance as the b*tchy Betty Warren at times is convincing since you dont like her but you dont really sympathize with her character very much at all and she comes out very shrilly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Even when she strays from her mother and conservative views, her development is way too fast and it ends up becoming a very mediocre performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Julia Stiles  performance I found to be the most confusing because half the time, shes speaking in an English, New English, or a straightforward American accent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was very messy and her character was just totally generic, I did nt really care for her.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The films best performance for me goes to Ginnifer Goodwin as Constance since she was someone to sympathize with since she is nt the prettiest of the whole group but Goodwin plays her performance with a lot of heart.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Maggie Gyllenhaal delivers an excellent performance although she is not the scene-stealer many are saying.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Although I enjoyed her character in the film since she kind of played the big-sister role for other

found out why she sleeps with these men or anything.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It was very confusing to be quite honest with although Gyllenhaal, to her credit stood out on her own.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Marcia Gay Harden is the films most hilarious performance since she tries to teach the women how to please your husbands while having some sadness that she tries to hide through her humor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Harden, deserves a lot of credit for bringing him some much needed humor to the rigid, melodrama the film was going under.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, Mona Lisa Smile  is just a huge disappointing effort from Mike Newell despite some noteworthy performances from Marcia Gay Harden, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Ginnifer Goodwin.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was very clear from the start this film was made to get some attention for the Oscars but after the recent snub from the Golden Globes ( except for Best Original Song for Elton John, which is an all right song ); it s likely not to get any Oscar nominations for anyone involved except the costume and production designs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Fans of Julia Roberts might enjoy this although they might expect more from her as an actress instead of the name people know.","target":"Genuine

a truly awful adaptation from such a wonderful children's classic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So much could have been done with this classic story.","target":"Genuine

woman who had been raped by her stepfather and who had killed him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She is obviously quite disturbed, she keeps referring to the devil as the one who rapes her.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The session ends with her being dragged out of the room, kicking and screaming.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dr. Grey obviously doesn't

memory of what happened, all she remembers is the girl.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The bulk of the movie that follows involves a lot of\"boo\" scenes, as I call them - scenes that make you jump.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This type of thing was really overdone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well placed, these scenes can really add to a movie, but when there are too many you start to expect them and they lose their effect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'd much rather have a movie that messes with your mind rather than tests your reflexes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are a lot of creepy shots of the girl as a ghost, who seems to pop up randomly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At times it seems like the ghost is just playing with her, spooking her at the most inopportune of times ( even though I am sure this was unintentional ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After a while, that starts to get old, after all, we have all seen this sort of thing before in other ghost movies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm not sure where it started, but I want to know why almost all ghosts in recent films walk strange, in a disjointed weird way.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The first time I saw that it was creepy, but now it is practically cliche, and almost annoying.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know if I am giving anything away by saying this, but the whole\"help the ghost find justice so they can rest in peace and leave me alone\" thing is just getting old as well.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I almost groaned when this theme popped up in the movie ( though I should have expected it ).","target":"Genuine

am I to argue about the way a ghost reasons?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The climax of this film was a bit anticlimatic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know if I was just fed up with the blabbermouths behind me, or if I really didn't care how the movie ended.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The pieces just didn't seem to fit right, like they were parts from a different movie or something.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The suspense in this movie could have been done a bit better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some parts worked, most didn't.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A lot of stuff was immediately obvious, and the'twists' weren't all that surprising.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't really notice the special effects: that means they were good enough that they didn't stand out - that's a good thing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I don't like it when the special effects are obvious - they should blend with the movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There was one scene that could have been done a bit better, but overall the few times special effects needed to be used, they were done well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Despite the negativity about the movie, I do feel that Halle Berry did a really good job of playing the part of Dr. Grey.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Penelope Cruz was also very good as the highly disturbed Chloe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Robert Downey Jr's character ( Pete Graham ) was a bit shallow, but I think that may have been intentional.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, this movie is probably worth seeing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am left with an empty feeling where the creepiness should be after a good ghost story, so I'm a bit disappointed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This movie is rated R in the US,\" for

tries to regain her memory and prove her innocence, she is untimely haunted by disturbing visions that further persuades evidence of madness by her former colleagues, like Dr. Pete Graham ( ROBERT DOWNEY JR. ), Miranda's sympathetic but skeptical coworker who is wrestling with issues of his own - he is in love with Miranda.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The visions in question concern a mysterious young woman shivering naked in the road during that dark and stormy night when Miranda's trouble began.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These images are from a vengeful spirit in Miranda's mind, causing her to question many things about her own beliefs in psychology - such as, maybe the patients that say they are hearing voices really are hearing voices - and that perhaps she herself is possessed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In an ironic twist, we find Miranda's own treatment mirroring her old therapies used on dangerous patients such as Chloe ( Penelope Cruz ), whose confessions of satanic torture were dismissed by the prude Miranda as ramblings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The problem with being crazy is that no matter what you say or how well you say it, they'll still think you're crazy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This would have been a welcoming topic to play upon even if it has been done before, but the moment comes and then it passes as a means to give the viewers an uneasy feeling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Halle as a criminal psychologist was not a believable job.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She struggled on medical terminology and her character seemed unacquainted in her own environment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Miranda the patient was a more plausible impression, considering Halle Berry has a natural confused look on her face which enhances this role.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The movie talks horror and fear but delivers none.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The ambience has a natural feel for any\" B\" horror film, yet the actual scare tactics are implied by the storyline: The

formula.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Usually, someone was murdered and, usually, their ghost came back for revenge in a number of bizarre fashions.","target":"Genuine

lot classier than it deserves to be.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Halle Berry, gorgeous and with a surprisingly good screaming voice, threatens to pull a Cuba Gooding Jr. with her post-Oscar career in this tepidly written horror movie with the inexplicable title.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey, a prison psychologist specializing in dealing with the criminally insane.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Her primary patient, Chloe, played by the overrated Penelope Cruz, is a lisping example of

since Katherine wants every woman to make a choice, she's made her choice to be a housewife, and what's wrong with that?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From the moviemakers' point of view, the speech is meant to be ironic, but it actually leaks the ugly little secret that radical feminists don't want to hear: Another woman's choice doesn't always agree with your own.","target":"Genuine

comedy, then a movie will magically rise from it all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Presto!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's magic!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the case of Elf, it's a mess.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I kept on looking for a point to the story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The premise of it, written by David Berenbaum, was pretty blase to begin with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only way Jon could have rescued it was to ensure that he had a capable set of actors along with a sentimental heart-beat running throughout, in order to keep the audience's attention.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Second, the only time he seemed to elicit a laugh from the

about Will Farrell.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If he was playing my kid - as either a child or a full grown adult - I think that I would have to smack him.","target":"Genuine

so clued in movie characters ( think Tom Hanks in Big ), what you get here is a one-track, annoying and irritating male.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I kept on thinking - if Jon Faverau can't direct you, do something for yourself dude!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But he didn't.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And that's so sad, too bad for him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Looks like Jack Black won the cross-over award for the year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mary Steenburgen, Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, and the rest of the actors were fine enough.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's not like there was any Oscar-stretching material that they were having to deal with.","target":"Genuine

know that as the credits rolled, I saw songs by Ella Fitzgerald and Lena Horne but hey - I must have totally zoned those out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here's the bottom line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The movie had no heart.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There was nothing present that made me care for the story or for any of the characters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No heart=the inability for me to overlook the mistakes made by Jon Favreau's poor directing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The End","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Elf is rated PG for some mild rude humor and language.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Your 6-9 year old will probably laugh more than you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How pathetic is that?!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ok let me get this out of the way: I did NOT like this movie.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Borderline hated it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now if you are only after positive reviews, then you might skip this, but if you are interested in why I thought it sucked, read on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To begin with, I only mildly like Will Ferrell.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't think hes funny at all on SNL, but I was willing to give him a chance.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I had seen previews for this a few weeks before it came out and it looked interesting, so I figured I would give it a shot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm very thankful that a local theater gives military discounts, I only paid $ 5.50 to see it, and after watching the movie, I feel like I COMPLETELY WASTED my money.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's a 100 % kids movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is ZERO bad language in it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The special effects and props are EXTREMELY low budget and so fake its not even funny.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can clearly tell what parts were filmed on a sound stage, as the backgrounds are blatently fake, no effort was put into them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Will Ferrell plays Buddy, an adult elf.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The whole plot is basically that he snuck into Santas toy bag as a baby, wound up at the north pole, and was raised by elves.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He comes to find out he has a father, played by James Caan, and goes on a journey to New York in search of him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's the entire plot right there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm not going to bother spelling out what happens in the movie because enough people mentioned it already.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The purpose of my review is for adults that think its a comedy and want to check it out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I regret ever seeing it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Almost every\"funny\" part is in the previews.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here are the funny parts: he drinks an entire 2 liter of coke and lets out a 30 second ( or so ) belch; a scene where he tries to put a star on top of the christmas tree and it comes crashing down on him; he attacks a fake Santa at a store because its not the real Santa.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yep, there you have it, those are the funny parts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No really, stop laughing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is no bad language at all, nothing derogatory, no put downs, nothing sexual.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm actually surprised Disney didn't make this movie since Disney movies aren't funny and geared towards kids.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The plot is pathetically weak and totally predictable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's one of those Ernest Saves Christmas type movies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After watching this flick, I will never watch Will Ferrell again.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He's just NOT funny.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fact, if I were him, I would be ashamed of myself for signing such a horrible contract and agreeing to make a lame movie like this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ok... so anything positive about this movie?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No, not really.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Actors are brain dead, rely on childish type humor to make the audience laugh, and you don't do a very good job convincing the audience even for a moment that this is a fantasy flick.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm sure children would like it, as its geared strictly for them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Adults who like clean humor and Disney type not funny movies will probably like this.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's a completely disconnect the brain, plan on wasting some money and a few hours of your life, and go see it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't recommend this to anybody looking for a serious laugh, or even a little bad language.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Obviously this is just my opinion, I don't expect others to feel this way, but if you like adult humor, decent acting, a movie with a plot, and a believeable movie set, then avoid this movie like the plague.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you have seen it and disagree with me, to each his own.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's a big hole at the center of Elf, and his name is Will Ferrell.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The movie's premise is that Santa Claus ( Ed Asner ) accidentally hijacks a baby to the North Pole.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The baby is named Buddy ( played by Ferrell ) and raised by a senior elf ( Bob Newhart ) as one of the North Pole's own.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Eventually, Buddy is sent back to his home town of New York to find his biological father ( James Caan ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The opening scenes are a letter-perfect take-off on the Rankin-Bass Christmas TV specials.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And Newhart's straight-to-the-camera, deadpan narration sets the perfect tone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But as soon as Buddy hits Manhattan, the movie starts going awry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are many scenes of broad physical comedy where Buddy is overawed by modern life and misinterprets people's commands to him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If ever there was a pregnant premise for comedy, a naive, six-foot-tall elf set loose in unforgiving New York City ought to be it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But Will Ferrell is not the man for the job.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Steve Martin and Jim Carrey have the wild abandon for this kind of thing, and heaven knows what elfin Robin Williams would have done with the role.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But Ferrell, another of those\" Saturday Night Live\" vets who go for nothing beyond the quick laugh, can't milk a routine to save his life.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And while everyone else in the movie seems sincerely committed to the story's potential sweetness, Ferrell's elf is little more than a variation on his\"SNL\" old routine as a hyperactive male cheerleader.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Elf is inoffensive enough, and kids will probably lap it up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But even the children at the preview audience seemed more grossed out than cheered by some of the movie's Ferrelly Bros.-like humor, such as Buddy re-chewing discarded bubble gum or pouring maple syrup on everything he eats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you're a discriminating adult, Elf probably won't be much more palatable.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Elf is rated PG for minor adult language and references.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of all the cartoon classics that made themselves a daily routine during those sweltering summer vacations in Jacksonville, The Cat In The Hat ranks as possibly THE one that I watched the most.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If machines could think, that VCR probably would have dealt me a few spankings of its own.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I felt mostly ambivalent toward 2001's The Grinch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I liked what they did, it just wasn't the same.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With The Cat In The Hat, it's mostly more of the same.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I hesitate to have too much faith in my own intolerably inane skills as a critic, because how do you know when exactly you're crossing the line between saying that the movie blows and saying that growing up blows?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe that's all it is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'll tell you this much -- I laughed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had a good time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were loads of one-liners, funny faces, pranks, and even a few brushes with vulgarity ( none of which would compel me to deprive my own kids of the pleasure, had I any ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The atmosphere was right on target, even if much happens outside the house itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's difference number one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The differences between the new and the old go on for miles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Foremost among them is the plot, and in second place is a whole lot of character conflict.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But let's start with the plot, shall we?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the original, it was all about trying to find that moss-covered three handled family gredunza.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cat busted in the house all angry, the kids just looked at each other like\" What?\" Remember that scary music that played?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here, it goes completely the other way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Cat appears out of nowhere and the kids run away screaming.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then, they just start having fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's basically it, except for some line of bologna about showing the boy ( Spencer Breslin ) how bad it is to make a mess.. by making a bigger one, and showing the girl ( Dakota Fanning ) how not to be so uptight.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"( Deja vu, anyone? )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the original, the fish was THE antagonist.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He was actually a frustrating character to watch, and when he was finally converted via a little language lesson ( a gato in a sombrero, you say? ), it was such a great moment!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here, he is just another victim of the haphazard shenanigans, or worse yet, a reminder of how much better Finding Nemo was.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Closest thing to an antagonist here is a next-door neighbor who is trying to impress the kids' mother by looking like a rich guy, but actually has false teeth and a beer gut, and sits in his house watching you-know-what.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No kidding.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Even more outlandish is his unsubstantiated obsession with disposing of the son by sending him off to military school.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dylan was right, the times they are a changin'.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of my favorite parts of the original was when they went on the big scavenger hunt for the moss-covered three handled family gredunza, and they have to mark all the places where it isn't.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It isn't in this keyhole ( No? ) and it isn't on my knee ( Hmm, mark the keyhole K-300, mark the knee 57-G! ) Okay, it's a little sad that I still remember that.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But I was saddened that they couldn't have found a way to at least incorporate this into the new one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Or how about\" Nobody Loves Me\"?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As if this all were not enough, the mystery surrounding the mother has been completely uncloaked.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"She's a legally blonde... something, I don't remember ( my bad! ) and she is hosting a party at her house that night.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If it's not clean, she will be fired, because her boss has verminophobia.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"How perfect is that?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Couldn't they just have gotten the house clean for the sake of having it clean?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why do we need an elaborate backstory to it?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thing 1 and Thing 2 are only there because they have to be.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And not to hit below the belt or anything, but they looked absolutely frightening!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Humor these days has become so random.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think it's almost gotten to a point where\" the more absurd, the better\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are traces of toilet humor, situational humor, irony, exaggeration, sarcasm and all that jazz.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Chances are you're going to laugh more than a few times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But you may groan as much.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As far as songs go, the Cat himself got to sing and dance, and he was quite the wire jumper.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But oftentime, it went by so fast that you could barely tell what he was saying.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know how much Smash Mouth paid ( or got paid ) to have 1/3 of their album played behind this thing either, but it must've been a pretty penny!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Acting? Don't ask.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is the stuff of third-grade school plays.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Which, as I always say, is probably the whole idea.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But I'll say this much -- Sean Hayes playing the Mom's boss makes the wildest Jim Carrey look like a sane individual.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"His character is utterly SMACKED out of his mind.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sean's\"moment\" near the beginning was one of my biggest laughs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't know if the same will hold true for you folks, probably not!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Bottom line, don't be a rule breaker.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Above all else, Keep It Simple Stupid!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh, but how funny is it that I should bring up KISS while talking about this movie!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You know what I'm about to say...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'll be the first to admit that I was never a big fan of Dr. Seuss's, Cat In The Hat.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My speed was more, In A People House and Green Eggs and Ham.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When Ron Howard and Brian Grazer announced that they were moving forward with a Cat In The Hat movie, I wasn't expecting much.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After all, The Grinch, also based upon a Dr. Seuss book, had a lot of flash, but not much substance.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So why did I go?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My nine year old loved the trailers and hey - who can say no to a nine year old?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Off we went, braving the crowds of snotty-nosed kids, and stressed-out looking parents...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I assume you're familiar with the book so I won't rehash the entire plot...The movie loosely follows the book, taking lots of modern day liberties.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The\" Mom\" ( Kelly Preston ) is a single parent to Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) and Sally ( Dakota Fanning ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"By day, she works at Humberfloob Real Estate for the meticulously, germ-free, Mr. Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"By night, she allegedly dates next door neighbor, Quinn ( Alec Baldwin ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Conrad is your typical adolescent male.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Always getting himself into trouble.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Always harassing his sister.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Always trashing the house.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sally is your typical good girl.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She makes lists of things to do on her electronic organizer ( Make today's to do list, Be spontaneous, Research graduate schools ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One day, their usual babysitter is unable to stay with them and Mom must find a replacement.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before returning to work, she specifically tells Conrad and Sally that they are not to step a foot into the living room, or else.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You see, she's throwing a very important party that night for work and the last time she did this, her house was a mess and her neat-freak boss was on the verge of firing her for it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After mom leaves, the kids sit at the window, watching the rain poor down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A noise interrupts their boredom and when they go to investigate, they find the Cat ( Mike Myers ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After getting over their initial fears, they soon realize that the Cat is here to make their lives fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fun!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Too bad fun includes loosing the dog, trashing the house, and getting the kids in trouble with Quinn.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And that's enough of the story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think this is also where I tell you...and by this point in the movie, I was ready to leave...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So what went wrong?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The list is long, but distinguished.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, every good part of the movie was featured in the trailers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That sucked.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can only venture that Universal Studios saw the movie, figured out how bad it was, but then patted themselves on the back for being able to pluck out three minutes of decent material.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For shame...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Second, Mike Myers, who I normally adore, ran amuck with his one-person SNL skits.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While those work in small, contained areas, or in less traditional stories like Austin Powers, he picked the wrong character to take off the beaten path.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was disappointed in him however, my real anger has been turned to the director, Bo Welch","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Who is this guy Bo Welch and why did Brian Grazer allow him to direct a multi-bazillion dollar movie?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What, his buddy Ron Howard wasn't available?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What about the three million other directors who could have turned this picture into something salvageable?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here was Bo's biggest issue.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He seemed to be overwhelmed by the Dr. Seuss legend.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He seemed to be afraid to do different things to endear us to the characters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead, he let Mike Myers run amuck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Third, can we talk about the non-chemistry of Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Besides phoning in their performances, they seemed to have no real love for each other.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Perfect strangers have more chemistry than these two.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fourth, does Alec Baldwin THINK that he's funny?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've got news for him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He's not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I look

Mike Myers sing?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ewww...the selections were horrible, not to mention the fact that the tunes stuck out like sore thumbs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Sixth, whoever was responsible for the special effects needs to enroll themselves in the Pixar school of creativity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were several, obvious glitches and mistakes ( that should have been handled in editing but were not ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Overlooking the errors, anyone - especially Grazer or Welch - thinking that the special effects could carry the movie are obviously deluded and should seek strong medication immediately.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Seventh, the ever-wonderful Sean Hayes, who also does the voice of the fish, was relegated to a minor supporting role which sucked because his character had the opportunity to take this movie in a worthy direction.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But oh no.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Mr. Director must not be able to deal with animated characters...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now Kelly Preston didn't offend me, so I guess you can say that this was the most redeeming part of the movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cat In The Hat is rated PG for mild crude humor and some double ententres.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Personally, I can think of better things to do with your time than taking your kids to see this movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Get a pedicure.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Clean out your attic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Take a nap.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All much more worthy of your time... I promise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After having heard so many positive reviews of the movie Elf, including a recommendation by one of the people I work with who only goes to the movie once a year on Thanksgiving, we decided to take the kids to see it on a rainy Friday afternoon in New York.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The film begins with Pap Elf ( Bob Newhart ) relating just how Buddy  managed to come to live with the other elves in Santas workshop at the North Pole.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Poor Buddy was abandoned to an orphanage and never knew his real parents.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He crawled into Santas bag while Santa ( Ed Asner ) was chowing down on the milk and cookies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For some reason, Santa failed to notice his presence until they arrived back at the North Pole and Buddy crawled out of the bag.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Buddy ( Will Ferrell ) stays with them, but there are problems.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hes twice the size of the other elves.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He is nt capable of building toys with the same lightning-fast speed as the other elves ( must be something genetic ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Finally, he has a heart-to-heart with Pap Elf who tells him all about his mother who put him up for adoption and passed away, and his father, who live in New York as a book publisher.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh, and hes on the naughty list.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rest of the story involves Buddys quest to find his family in New York.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He finds his father, Walter Hobbs ( James Caan ) working in the Empire State Building, and discovers hes married with another son.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Walter was an interesting character.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He did nt seem to be a bad guy, just someone who managed to get off track in life as his main focus became dollar signs and not being happy with his life.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are many people out there like this who go into one profession or another ( in Walters case, publishing childrens books ) because of their initial fondness for the work, and end up obsessed with the financial aspect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This what how the character of Walter Hobbs struck me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Buddy may not have been the perfect elf, but hes picked up some amazing talents and abilities from being around them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"When he and his brother, Michael ( Daniel Tey ) are being chased by bullies through Central Park, Buddy manages to create a whole armload of snowballs in the time it takes Michael to create one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He can write a note on an Etch-a-Sketch faster than most people can on a pad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most of the really funny moments of the film comes as Buddy tries to adapt to the real world.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When he hears Santa will be arriving at Gimbels ( a department store that s been out of business for quite some time, by the way ), he makes all sorts of preparations in the toy department for him imminent arrival, only to be shocked when it s an imposter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When he tries to go to work with his father, he is sent to the mail-room, where he befriends a man on parole who is something of a slacker, and together they turn the mail-room upside-down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are also some truly humorous moments as it s shown that Buddy is so out of place in the elf world.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I dont know how it was done, but Bob Newhart was half the size of Will Ferrell, so this made for some pretty humorous situations.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There were also pictures of Buddy playing basketball with his fellow elves ( he looks bigger than Shaq ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Theres not much really in the way of gross-out humor, which was something I really appreciated.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Buddy eats some pretty strange combinations of food, and indulges in maple syrup on just about everything, along with finding  gum in some pretty odd places, but that s about it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The one bodily-noise humor comes after he chugs a full 2-liter of soda, but my feelings of dread that this was going to take a downturn in the humor department after this were not founded.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Will Ferrell captures Buddys essence perfectly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hes got a child-like innocence as he wanders around the city and has no real idea of the consequences of his actions at times.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ferrell plays Buddy perfectly - I did nt see him as dumb, only innocent and naive.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"His expressions of wide-eyed innocence at the events going on around him are also near-perfect, and not exaggerated nor over-done.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I credit director Jon Favreau for a lot of this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The film could have easily descended into being a farce, but he kept it in line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only bad point I came across was the ending which felt a bit too much like a rip-off of the ending to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, but the kids really enjoyed it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Zooey Deschanel is Buddys love interest, a worker at Gimbels named Jovie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She seems alone in the big city  and for Buddy, it s love at first sight, although it takes a while for his Christmas spirit to rub off on the dispirited Jovie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, it s Jovie who on their first date takes him to see the largest Christmas tree of all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For me, that was the real star of the movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I love going into New York City at Christmastime and walking around to see all of the decorations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The movie captures the store windows with their Holiday displays, the beauty of Rockefeller Center, and the decorations in some of the out-of-the way places.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This film should do a lot for NYC tourism during the holiday period.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While the film raptly kept my 8-year-olds interest, my 3-year-old was not impressed at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It failed to capture his attention as many of the animated films do, and he fell asleep in my arms near the end.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the film is rated PG, other than one friggin  and perhaps the burping scene and Buddys gum harvest, there was little that I could see that parents could complain about.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's also a good film if your kids still believe in Santa or are at the cusp where they are starting to have doubts, much like The Santa Clause was for my older daughter ( who opted to hang out with her friends rather than go to the theater with us - her loss ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a fun film for the whole family to enjoy this holiday season.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its got some terrific laughs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Im not a Will Ferrell fan at all, but I did enjoy this movie.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Christmas seems to be arriving earlier every year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Halloween and Thanksgiving are now the forgotten holidays as stores and businesses strum up garland and other holiday decorations in order to prepare for the hopefully fruitful shopping season ahead.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The movie industry must be thinking the same thing starting this year especially after the success of last years The Santa Clause 2, which opened the first weekend of November to nearly $ 30 million.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"New Line offers up their pre-holiday treat entitled Elf, which features the former Saturday Night Live comedian Will Ferrell, who has recently become a new rising star in Hollywood.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After the dismal first half of the year with flops like A Man Apart and The Real Cancun, the studio bounced back in the second half with Freddy vs. Jason, Secondhand Lions, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and hopes to continue the trend until their mega-success The Return of the King opens near Christmas.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Can Elf do that?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If it s anything like The Santa Clause 2, it easily could but the Ferrells comedy faces a lot more competition then Allens did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only does the film open up against The Matrix Revolutions, the yuletide feature goes head to head with the highly publicized The Cat in the Hat and Disneys The Haunted Mansion later this month.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Until then the film will have to build up pretty good word of mouth for it to still hear cash registers ringing come Christmas Day, let alone Thanksgiving.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Up at the North Pole, elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he does nt quite fit in.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Buddy is not the typical elf, his large size being the biggest factor.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santas gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santas Workshop.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After learning his true origin, Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Buddy, who has never been to the human world, is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that dont include sugar.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his fathers workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The story for Elf, though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down, works surprisingly well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This happens mostly in part to Ferrells performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead star.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Though the feature does nt have an exceptionally large cast, the film does nt have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Will Ferrell, who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School, once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"James Caan, who takes on the role of Buddys real father, has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only problem lied not with Caans performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddys adoptive father.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss  How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrells exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The slightly-predictable ending should nt ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ferrells over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced, here may be a better reason: Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Smart, huh?!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Elf is the story of a human who wandered into Santa's bag of toys while he was visitng a orphanage ( Will Ferrell ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He then grows up to realize that he is not an elf, and ventures out into the real world to find his father ( James Caan ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He finds him, and at first is not accepted.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, their relationship grows throughout the movie and it a great story, with humor for all ages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ferrell's comedy, both physical and witty, is enough to make you fall out of your seat, even if you are sitting on the floor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The situations he gets himself into by his curiousity and naiveness are endless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the irony of those situations is hilarious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can remember at least 10-15 distinct times when the whole audience sitting in the theatre laughed out loud.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although a comedy, this movie does have some touching moments.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Heck, it made me cry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not really cry like big time, but a tear did roll down my cheek, in more than one place.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The funny thing is, it was two different emotions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One was sadness, and the other was happiness.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Weird, isn't it?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anyway, I give this movie a great rating for its ability to play with my emotions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Laughter, happiness, sadness, and, yes, even guilt, played into my movie-watching experience when I payed my 9 dollars to watch Elf.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Great movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From Saturday night live to Old School and now to a even better and funnier movie...ELF.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Will Farrel plays the role of Buddy which is an unusual elf.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"An elf that is bigger than usual, has a lower voice that the rest, and is missing the pointy ears.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This movie is a very good family movie not just because it's about Christmas but because it has a good message to it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The message that some people have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas and have given up on Santa.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well this is a movie that you would want to see to bring back that Christmas cheer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have seen this movie twice now and can never stop laughing at Buddy's( Will Farrel ) actions to the city.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I really enjoy how Will can make a movie without using adult humor.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I only have one bad thing to say about this movie... I really don't like the angry elf.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Come join Buddy on his quest to find his father.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As an actor, Will Ferrell shows promise for hilarious movies, thus I am driven to see them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From the previews alone, I have been dying waiting for elf to come out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found it to be hysterical, as well as touching.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My boyfriend doesn't even like Christmas and told me he had goosebumps for the last 20 minutes of the movie.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Is there a lesson to be learned?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Does it matter?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Christmas is about feel-good movies and when do you feel better then when you are laughing","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sometimes, the problem with writing a review is just knowing whom youre writing it for.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thats because your target audience is an important consideration when youre recording your impressions on any given product.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Do they have the same taste as you?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Will they at least be able to understand your analysis and critique?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Any reviewer has his or her own biases, after all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its important for a reader to identify this, and then take any advice in a review accordingly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So whats the point of all this in relation the Universal Pictures  The Cat in the Hat? Were getting there, so please be patient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Admittedly, Universal has been plastering the airwaves with a steady barrage of commercials for this flick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Theyve also marketed it to the max, and Cat in the Hat merchandise is to be seen lately just about everywhere you go.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now that the film has been released, however, it has been generally panned by the professional critics, and more than a few Epinions reviewers seem to have had similar impressions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Theres just one problem with this that I can see.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Above all, this is a childrens film ( though some adults will enjoy it ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So what is the problem?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The children arent writing the reviews.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That said, I thought I would attempt to take a kids perspective into view in writing my own review.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But before all of that, let it be known that The Cat in the Hat is loosely based on Dr. Seuss childrens story of the same name.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That story was not an exceedingly long one, so as you can imagine the film has been extended quite a bit with original material in order to make it a feature length film.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Even at that, it s only about 82 minutes, rather brief indeed by todays standards.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The action follows little Sally ( Dakota Fanning ) and Conrad ( Spencer Breslin ) who live with their mom in a house like any other in the quaint town of Annville.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As with any kids, Sally and Conrad have their own little idiosyncrasies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Conrad just loves to break the rules, and to do the opposite of whatever hes told.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sally, by contrast, is quite the opposite.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Shes a stickler for being organized, prim and proper, so much so that it has cost her her friends.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Enter mom Joan ( Kelly Preston ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Shes involved with the guy next door ( Alec Baldwin ), who cant stand the kids, and is trying to convince Joan to place Conrad in military school.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Joan is torn on what to do, and to add to her problems her retentive boss Mr. Humberfloob ( Sean Hayes ) wants to host an important company party at her home.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Which must be, of course, spotless, dooming the kids to a rainy day of boredom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To keep the house clean, theyre restricted as to what they can do.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Until, that is, a mysterious six-foot tall talking cat in a magical hat ( Mike Myers ) arrives and changes all the rules.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And that s how the fun begins.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the movie is fun.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Admittedly, Myers does at times fall flat more than a few times with lines that just arent that funny.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But more often than not, hes very funny, and at times hilarious.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"His interaction with Sally and Conrad are well executed, and both Fanning and Breslin give adequate performances.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Make no mistake, neither one is as charming as, say, McCauley Culkin in Home Alone or Uncle Buck, but they are convincing enough in their roles for the film to work.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Kelly Preston has little to do and not much time to do it in.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Baldwin, however, is a convincing bad guy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its fun watching him go down.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sean Hayes is also a lot of fun in his brief appearances as Humberfloob.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Much of the magic of the film, however, is the fantastic world imagined by Seuss and brought to life on the big screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sets are delightful, as are the amazing characters Thing One and Thing Two.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The special effects that bring them and their amazing antics to life are a lot of fun indeed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With a stretched plot and at times juvenile humor level, this film wont appeal to all adults.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I laughed a lot and enjoyed it, but for many it may be best to wait for this one to hit the DVD shelves.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But how about kids?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How do they like it?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is, after all, a childrens story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When we attended, the kids in the audience seemed magically enthralled, eyes fixed on the screen throughout the film and with nary a sound escaping their lips except for the frequent fits of laughter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Kids 11 and under will likely love the film.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are a few moments of implied adult humor, but theyre mild and theres nothing that kids will really pick up on.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"At the end of the film, kids were calling the Cat cool, although Thing One and Thing Two seemed to get more praise than the Cat himself did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The film seemed to be very popular, and I think its rather brief running time is perfectly suited for younger ( and shorter ) attention spans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's even a bit of a moral at the end as the youngsters learn something about themselves through their experiences with the Cat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ill reiterate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Cat in the Hat is a childrens film above all else, and when judged on that criteria it s a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with your youngsters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dont expect more from it, and you may even enjoy the film along with them, as I did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This movie portrays the the children's story\" The Cat in the Hat\" in a very colorful and original manner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The children are adorable and the cat is very amusing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I especially enjoyed thing one and thing two, with their over the wall antics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a truly original movie, which brings a cartoon to life.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals no details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I drag my friends to see Gothika, why?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because I am a person who loves horror films--all types and the previews looked enticing enough.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So off we went to see the film, and overall, I was impressed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The videography of the film was great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Camera direction, eery set, but I think what made this film was the music.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes, believe it or not, had the music not been suspenseful and skillfully placed at scenes where the audience got tense, then this film would have been a flop.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The music added such intensity, it was similar to what made Friday the 13th films memorable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another thing that was great was the acting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, I am usually never disappointed with Halle's acting, she is extremely good.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But I was quite shock to see her play such a role that was different that her usual roles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was great!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She fell so many times during the movie that I know realize how she broke her arm on the set.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What was not so great about the movie was that there were gaps in the plot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would like to see more character establishment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plus, the role that Downey Jr. played was a little unclear--was he an obstacle or not?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also, how did Halle get off from murdering a man?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These questions were not really answered.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The idea of the film is not new either.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It was like a different version of the Sixth Sense, but in a more perverse way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, I forgive that because it seemed to work out at the end.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Overall, I would recommend this movie to people who loves to go out on dates, because if she is as squeamish as I, you will be in for a treat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let's start at the beginning.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I adore Disney's Haunted Mansion in the Orlando theme park.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is for everybody.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is funny/scary, and as Disney caters to CHILDREN, all is as it should be.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Things are themed to death, ghosts, and the supernatural in a very fun and creative climate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Beginning with\" no windows and no doors,\" you are sucked right into the spirit of the house - moving doors, talking head in a crystal ball, hearse with skeleton horse attached, tombstones with funny saying on it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The ride is absolutely very well done!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I see something new every time I take the ride and I've done it well over 12 times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Okay - now let's translate that thought into a movie!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a fantastic idea!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The very first line\" Welcome foolish mortals\" made me just giggle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You begin the film with a married couple with 2 kids ( pretty standard Disney stuff ), and the dad is too busy at work ( again, par for the course, but we have been doing this since at least\" Mary Poppins,\" you know? ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So with one phone call, the family is drawn into\" the house.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That the dad is Eddie Murphy to me isn't that special a thing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I think Eddie Murphy is less funny than he used to be, but he is one of only a handful of comedic black movie stars today.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You enter the house and see the cobwebs on the grandiose front entryhall.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The monolithic ceilings, the candlelit hallways, the suits of armor, the gigantic fireplace ( might be known as gates of Hell, or it might not ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The busts in the walls move and watch you, there are hidden stairways, and most and best of all, there are ghosts everywhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are good ones and bad ones, and all the family take off in different directions with the mom being the most sought after by the house's owner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm not going to give away the plot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Suffice it to say there is a trip to the cemetery with ghouls worse than in the new\" Pirates of the Carribean\" movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But they don't last long.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And, of course, the boy learns to be a man in the process.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lady's head in the crystal ball is there, and she's even green.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's a barber shop quartet of busts, and even the hearse fits in there somehow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ending is where the bad guys get their due, and it is, after all, a Disney comedy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This movie is not too scary for the youngest of children, but the plot might confuse kids under 8 or 9. PG is a good rating for a few mild oaths.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Generally, if everyone would keep in mind that Disney makes things for children ( and there are always new ones coming along!!! ), they would know that this is just a wonderful experience, compared to THE CAT IN THE HAT which is obscene from what I've heard and read.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"See this movie; take anyone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It kept my attention, and I am very Disney-fied.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It lasts 110 minutes, and they are fabulous times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well acted, well conceived, and great effects.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A great Disney romp!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals no details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As the parent of a 5 year old who had just returned from a one week vacation at Walt Disney World, the inescapable fact was that we WERE going to see this movie (unless it was X-rated due to full-frontal nudity, etc. ) whether we adults liked it or not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After reading some of the critics reviews on the web, I had resigned myself that this would be an evening of altruistic self-sacrifice for

with anticipation.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The trailer did manage to make the film look fun, but the concept strongly reminded me of The Full Monty, which is a film I personally found a little overrated.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I wanted to add further concerns I could tell you about how I decided to search Epinions for some reviews on the film, and my search revealed nothing but a small selection of more, adult titles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nevertheless I recognized that not only did the trailer look fun, but I had been pleasantly surprised by another British comedy that didn't appeal to me, Bend It Like Beckham.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With those thoughts running through my mind I decided to throw caution to the wind and go down to the local cinema to see Calendar Girls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm glad I went to see it now, because the film has remained just that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fun!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It tells the story of 2 friends named Chris and Annie who are members of their local Womens Institute, but when Annie's husband comes down with Leukemia their lives are shattered.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before he died he wrote a poem about his flowers, and mentioned how flowers are like Women, they get more beautiful with age ( note-this does not necessarily reflect my own opinion ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After he's died the 2 of them decide to try and raise some money for a comfortable sofa in the hospital waiting room so that other grieving families can at least have a little comfort.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However since the women's Institute never makes money off their sales Chris decides to try a different approach, and gets a few of the other members to join her in making a nude calendar.","target":"Genuine

positive"},{"sentence":"Needless to say the Calendar is more than a local success, and by the time Hollywood beckons they have enough money to buy a settee and still donate 99 % of their earnings to cancer research.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet was the cost worth it?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As with most comedy's of this type the main reason is succeeds is it's absolutely charming cast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2 main characters alone are played by award winning actresses, Chris by Helen Mirran ( The Madness Of King George ) and Annie by Julie Walters ( Educating Rita ) and both give wonderful performances.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mirran absolutely nails the role of the fun loving Chris who has to remain down to earth for the sake of her companions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Walters gives a touching performance as the grieving widow determined to do anything to make money for others in her situation, but together their partnership becomes even more than the sum of it's parts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They display an amazing amount of chemistry and play off of each other's style just enough to keep the characters believable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They're supported well by an absolutely stellar cast though.","target":"Genuine

seeing her and just expecting her to be playing an uptight, prim and proper lady.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Especially when she came out talking with one of the most believable posh English accents yet filmed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However this confusion was the cause of some of the films bigger laughs as she was one of the more supportive characters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Crosbie and the other actresses didn't have to rely on just themselves though because they had the support of some good writers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The film featured quite a few genuine laugh out loud moments, such as the scene where Chris's son and his friend walk in whilst she's demonstrating the modeling.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That and other jokes had the audience literally roaring with laughter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yet what I liked best about the writing was not the jokes themselves, but with the way the material was handled.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's based on a true story, but that hasn't prevented historical inaccuracies in the past, and whilst I don't really know anything about what really happened, I do know that the film is more than just another feel good comedy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It actually gets the whole central story of making the calendar out of the way surprisingly early, but then goes on to examine the effects that modeling nude had on their lives.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Chris's teenage son feels so humiliated by the calendar that he turns to, what he believes are drugs; and another of the women arrives home to find her husband leaving her for another woman.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then as calendar really finds success they find themselves being exploited by people who have come to expect nudity from them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Throughout the film the material was sensitively and honestly handled in this same manner.","target":"Genuine

film that will likely earn the same sort of childish comments as Cathy Bates infamous scene in About Schmidt.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'll try to avoid those sort of comments here, but needless to say there will likely be some going in who wont be expecting any real nudity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For example I went in knowing the concept and was hoping that the nudity would remain what you see in the photo's, but in between the shoots there is some brief nudity, and the shoots themselves get a little close to the bar of a 12 rated movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However you feel about nudity in films, it's unlikely that many people will actually want to see this so I posted this little warning here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you don't think you'll mind some mild nudity involving older ladies though, then Calendar Girls is a fun, well acted and at times emotional movie that's worth seeing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Calendar Girls is rated 12A, for mild nudity and some bad language","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Haunted Mansion was a fun Disney movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because Disney produced this film, you would nt expect the film to be scary, but to the contrary, my wife screamed several times and

thought it would be fun to see so I agreed to see it with her.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was thinking that it would be lame as I thought Eddie Murphy did a bad job on Dr.

movie where I wanted to look down at my watch and see how much longer we had before we could leaveand Im a stubborn goat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The film would be wonderful for

sounds ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am one who analyzes films enough to predict the next action taken, but this film gave a few surprises ( I will be creating films as a computer animator, thus I analyze ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I found it interesting that the story was told well and it corresponded enough with the ride to have a familiar tone, but had enough originality that I did not feel as though I was on the ride I have ridden hundreds of times before ( being a former mouse employee ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The beginning of the story took a while to run and made me a little anxious to get on with the rest of the film so I could see how the movie would relate to the ride.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would suggest this movie as a date movie or a friends or family  gathering movieand a fun one to watch in a theater setting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As for home viewing, I would suggest it if you have a good bass backing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Wonderful job, Disney","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not since Dan Akroyd donned his own thread bare red and

just a preview in a very very long time.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That being said, I was nervous about this flick because there are oh so many times where the preview shows you the only good and or funny parts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For those who had the same fear as I did, you may have no fear.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Bad Santa is the most deliciously gut-busting adults only comedy since 1999's South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Directed by Terry Zwigoff ( Ghost World ), and produced by the Coen brothers ( Fargo, The Big Lebowski ), Bad Santa stars Billy Bob Thornton as Willie T Soke, a plus-size bottom sex craved depressed alcoholic who cracks safes.","target":"Genuine

cash and untold value in merchandise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The set up this year is Phoenix, Arizona.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They get a job at a mall, replacing a 5 years running Santa thanks to the penny pinching attitude of the mall/store ( it's unclear which one he really is ) manager, played by the late John Ritter in one of his final film roles.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Within five minutes of having the job, however, Willie is already being looked at suspiciously by the manager, thanks to his constant swearing and his

behavior.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" The Kid\" ( as Thornton refers to him throughout the movie ) follows Thornton to a bar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's in this

sex in the plus size fitting rooms, showing up late and or drunk to work, and becoming slower and slower on the safecracking year after year.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Willie, meanwhile, becomes a sort of father figure to Thurman, despite the fact that he sees nothing but a loser in the kid.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He questions why he doesn't stand up to the skate punks who pick on him, and tries his best to teach him to fight.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One might think that with this set up, a warm, happy ending is in the cards.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Think again.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What makes Bad Santa such a good movie, and not just a funny one ( an apt description for say, Mallrats, which is far from good, but damned funny ), is that it holds no expectations for itself.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It crashes down on the holiday season the way that the previously mentioned South Park film crashed down on musicals.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Kid does bring out a bit of humanity or soul or whatever in Thornton's character, but because Thornton's' Santa' is so black in spirit, any redemption or humanity is short lived.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The one drawback to the film is in some of its pacing and editing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The scenes between Ritter and Mac in particular feel like they weren't even shot at the same time with them in the same room.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Completely vulgar and politically incorrect ( a few choice losers are protesting because it's put out by a Disney subsidiary, I say to all of you: GET A LIFE), Bad Santa is most certainly NOT for the kiddies ( as if the previews didn't already make THAT expressly clear ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So if you and the wife/husband want a night out alone with a film that will make you laugh harder than any other film this year, get a babysitter and go see Bad Santa.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Besides the kids, you may want to leave your pretensions at the house as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Bad Santa has officially topped Pirates of the Caribbean and Bruce Almighty as my favorite film of the

Santa\" is not for you.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But if you have a soft spot in your funny bone for the darker aspects of human nature, if the caustic comedy of directors like Danny DeVito and the Woody Allen of\" Deconstructing Harry\" causes you to break out in uncontrollable guffaws, if you're as fed up as Charlie Brown with the commercialization of Christmas cheer and would like to see this cynical marketing of a simple holiday blown a wet, beery razzberry, then read on, boys and girls, because\" Bad Santa\" is the film you've been waiting for your whole life.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many critics praise an actor's bravery when they take on a role like that of Cuba Gooding's mentally challenged football booster in the recent syrup production machine\" Radio\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But a character like that is calculated to warm hearts and win Oscars; the risk factor is minimal unless you overplay and come off as a caricature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You want a risk?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How about trying out a role like\" Bad Santa\"'s Willie T. Soke?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Played by Billy Bob Thornton ( in a role originally intended for Bill Murray ), Willie is a boozy, foul-mouthed, degenerate nihilist with a soul as black as coal ( which is more of a Christmas gift than he ever got from his abusive monster of a dad ) who uses the Santa cover to case department stores which he then robs on Christmas Eve with his partner Marcus ( Tony Cox ), a little person who plays Santa's elf.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the while, Willie abuses the kids who come to see him, uses more four-letter words than the entire population of South Park, steals cars, carries on an affair with a waitress ( Lauren Graham ) with a fetish for Santa hats, nails overweight women in the big and tall dressing stalls, and drowns the fire of his self-hatred with enough booze to swamp the Titanic ( he rides up the escalator to\" Santa's Village\" lying on his face, a broken bottle clutched in his jolly old fist ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At one point, he wets his Santa pants right in front of the children, and this is actually one of his more forgivable offenses because he's so drunk he doesn't even realize what he's done.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the while, Willie spews invective at anyone who gets within his field of vision, cursing Christmas and family and the whole shebang.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Playing a character like this is a REAL risk.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you play it badly, it's just an embarrassment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you play it well, some people will not be able to separate the actor from the character and excoriate the performer as a monster just for doing his job to the best of his ability.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is to the endless credit of Thornton, an actor who has made a career out of socially maladjusted misfits (\" Sling Blade\",\" A Simple Plan\" ), that he seems to have taken to this role without a moment's thought about what a monster like Willie could do to his public image.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He growls the character's endless obscenities with a phlegm-throated relish, throws himself into twisted misbehavior with heedless abandon...and what's most amazing of all, somehow manages, against all our better instincts, to move us with this portrayal of a hateful man by never letting us forget that he hates himself most of all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"\" I am not Santa Claus\", he tells a little boy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" If anything, I'm living proof that there isn't any Santa Claus.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Willie is a man who has lost his capacity to believe in anything, most of all himself, and the wasted excess that is his life is no Dionysian revel, but rather the extended suicide of a man who feels that he has more than earned all his self-inflicted suffering ( at one point, feeling that even he is being too easy on himself, Willie tries to take himself out with carbon monoxide in a garage...all while wearing the Santa suit, of course ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is a character which, if handled incorrectly, could have ruined Thornton's career.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Lucky for him, and for us, that the actor sees the humanity in Willie and lays it bare, along with the baser indignities man is capable of inflicting upon himself and the world.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a monumental comic performance, funny as hell and lived in down to the gin-soaked bones by a great actor, and the Oscar nominees are incomplete if they do not include him ( which I have every reason to suspect they will not, as Gooding's Rain Man of the gridiron is much more the type of up-with-people role the Oscars tend to reward ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For all its dark R-rated excesses,\" Bad Santa\" is ultimately, like many of the greatest Christmas movies, a story of redemption.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Willie, in Phoenix with Marcus for their annual Christmas scam ( they've been pulling their Santa heist for years, living high off the proceeds, but always financially dry as a bone come Thanksgiving ), finds that the job will not come as easy as it has to him in the past.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Their department store's sharp-tongued detective ( Bernie Mac ) and jittery manager ( John Ritter in his final film role ) are keeping a close eye on this suspiciously woozy Saint Nick.","target":"Genuine

go.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At first, Willie takes advantage of the situation, moving into Thurman's house, which the boy shares only with a deeply out-of-it grandmother ( Cloris Leachman ); his father is in prison for insider trading, his mother\"is in heaven with God and the baby Jesus...and the talking walnut\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But soon, Willie starts to realize that this sad sack of a kid, with his snot-crusted upper lip and Cupid-curls hair, who gets beaten up on a daily basis by skateboard punks and who exalts over an almost-all-C's report card, needs almost as much help as Willie himself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And Thurman, to his credit, does not believe that this bleary-eyed human trash heap is really Santa Claus.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He just desperately needs to believe in something, or else one day he just might find himself in a Santa suit, throwing up in an alley, just like his new best friend.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thankfully,\" Bad Santa\" manages to tell this Yuletide story of a monster's salvation without resorting to the\" Will Ferrell learns the true meaning of Christmas\" cliches that have sent many a holiday audience into sugar shock over the years.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Director Zwigoff's past films, including the remarkable documentary\" Crumb\" and the dark but surprisingly sweet\" Ghost World\", have evinced a soft spot for the disenfranchised and misunderstood souls of the world, and the miracle of those films is that he allows us to see and embrace the humanity of these creatures without soft-pedaling the weirdness and nihilism that has made them outsiders to begin with.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Thurman's plight does make a dent in Willie's stone heart, but a dent is all it is; for all we know, he'll go right on boozing and cussing and banging fat chicks till his liver

gift of a wooden pickle, when Thurman announces that Santa hasn't brought him a Christmas present for the last two years\"because I know I'm just a dips--t loser\"...you can't help but root for these guys.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe not to become president, but at least for Thurman to get the pink stuffed elephant he so dearly wants for Christmas.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"At least for Willie to find a reason to rise from the booze-and-puke puddle that is his life and see another dawn.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That Zwigoff manages to move us with these characters, all the while causing us to laugh in disbelief at the extremity of Willie's awfulness and the film's lack of faith in the standard Hollywood-Christmas quick fix, is a great testament to both the director's delicate touch and to the skilled work of writers John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, who also scripted the darker-and-funnier-than-expected\" Cats and Dogs\" ( the script went through several uncredited rewrites, including one by executive producers Joel and Ethan Coen and one by Zwigoff himself ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, regardless of how unexpectedly touching the film may be,\" Bad Santa\" is still the blackest comedy in many a moon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am personally tired of Hollywood

negative"},{"sentence":"\" Bad Santa\" is the first comedy I've seen in a long time that is outrageous in the literal sense of the term; several critics have already excoriated it as mean-spirited beyond redemption, and a possibly-apocryphal internet news item had Walt Disney CEO Michael Eisner ( Disney owns Miramax subsidiary Dimension, which released this film ) denouncing the picture as an insult to the memory of the company's founder.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the film is guilty of everything it's been accused of.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's

us of a message that is always useful to hear: no one, even the most loathsome of us all, is completely without value.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's the same message as\" It's a

past.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When he figures out what theyre doing  robbing the store  he wants a cut of the loot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thankfully, there is a charming kid, Thuman Merman ( portly cherubic Brett Kelly ) who believes in Willie and adopts him as a surrogate dad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( I wont reveal where the real dad is ) No matter how awfully Willie talks to the kid, he so desperately wants a male figure he accepts Willie for what he is.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Theres an attractive barmaid ( Lauren Graham ) who has a fetish for Santas and has fun as Willies sex mate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If these characters werent so unbelievably funny they would be implausible.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Everything that s politically incorrect ( alcohol binging, swearing, loud-mouth insults ) is there.","target":"Genuine

who with the help of his dwarf-friend Marcus ( Tony Cox ) robs shopping malls after posing as Santa during the holiday season.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On this particular go, the pair winds up in Arizona, an inspired choice since the Southern California thing has been done to death.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"John Ritter plays a department store manager, who in an attempt to cut-costs, fires the store's regular Santa and hires the cheaper Billy-bob.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then, the fun begins...","target":"Genuine

for the holiday season.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Luckily, I get these nice invitations from the Philadelphia Film Society to attend sneak previews and premieres, so my wife and I found ourselves treated to a free screening of this film a good month before it hits theaters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is not the type of film I normally enjoy seeing in the theater, by the way.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For me, the big-screen experience is all about stunning visuals, thundering sounds, and jaw-dropping special effects.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That said, I completely enjoyed Calendar Girls as a happy, spirited, light-hearted, peculiarly English comedy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Characters and Plot","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Knapely chapter of the Women's Institute ( W.I. ) isn't very interesting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, it's downright boring.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Topics like the history of broccoli and carpets tend to predominate the presentations, and right from the beginning, we find ourselves laughing along with our two main protagonists, Annie ( Julie Walters ) and Chris ( Helen Mirren ), as they suffer through the deadly dull pontifications that make up the WI meetings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Early in the film, however, tragedy sets in as Annie's husband begins an unsuccessful battle with leukemia.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fairly soon after his death, the Knapely W.I. finds itself once again in the position of having to publish its annual calendar for charity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead of the usual church buildings or pictures of Yorkshire, however, Chris decides that something different is needed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After receiving some inspiration from one of her son's\"adult\" magazines and a gas-station biker-chick calendar, she conceives the idea of a calendar picturing various members of the W.I. in the nude.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course, they would be doing very W.I.-appropriate activities while in their birthday suits, so it would be more classy than crass.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The money raised would go to the local hospital's leukemia ward.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Soon, despite opposition from the local chapter president, and some last-minute pleas to the general W.I. convention, the calendar goes to press.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What follows is a media frenzy that was entirely unexpected, leading to BBC spots, tabloid reporters, Late Night appearances, sleazy Hollywood directors, and lots and lots of money raised for the local hospital.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What Did I Think?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I really liked Calendar Girls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Part of its charm as a film is its very charming cast of characters, especially the female leads.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Helen Mirren sparkles as Chris, portraying a small-town woman with an abundance of energy, enthusiasm, and grit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Julie Walters brings a quiet poignancy to Annie, with an undercurrent of humor and grace.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Almost all of the other W.I. women are very believable in their characters, with a whole range of body types and personalities to round out the calendar ( and film ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One of the wonderful elements of this picture is its celebration of beauty outside of Hollywood and magazine pages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Helen Mirren, undeniably a very attractive older woman, brings a spark of glamour to the story, but the very ordinariness of many of the other women, and the art with which they are presented in the calendar is a refreshing reminder that beauty can be more than we see in Cosmopolitan and Access Hollywood.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Despite all the high-sounding declarations above about beauty and truth, the simple fact is that this is a fun movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The subject matter lends itself to all sorts of hilarity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From the reactions of the models' husbands and families, to the media blitz, there are many moments of outright laughter throughout the film.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Anything Wrong With It?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were a few flaws I found in Calendar Girls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A few conflicts were developed that never found any resolution in the film.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Of course, there is no absolute necessity to wrap everything up neatly by the end of an hour and a half, but it is nice to see at least the beginnings of a resolution on most of the issues.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One particular storyline involving Chris's son does provide a few comedy and a few drama moments, but peters out, or is lost in the wash of the story's climax.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other small complaint I could express regards the Hollywood furor that develops around the Knapely women.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This segment of the film, while funny at times, devolves into a not-too-subtle critique of Hollywood and the television industry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm all for critiquing the establishment, by the way, but to my mind, transferring the movie's action to L.A. stripped away some of the English charm that had attended it to that point.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That said, it doesn't by any means ruin the film.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just found that portion to be a bit more forced than the rest.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Final Thoughts","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Calendar Girls is quite simply an all-around enjoyable film.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The acting is solid, the premise is believable ( good thing, as it's based on a true story ), and the whole experience is rife with humor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The few flaws hardly detract from the general sense of enjoyment engendered by the movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even if this kind of film isn't your cup of tea, think about renting it when it hits your local video store.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's definitely worth seeing if you're home for a quiet evening.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The juxtaposition of the words British and comedy  is enough to strike fear into the hearts of even the hardiest cinema-goer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, Calendar Girls  proves to be a rather impressive exception to the norm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The film is based on the real-life events from a Yorkshire village a few years ago, although the Director was keen on maintaining that the individual characters in the film are not themselves based on the real-life women.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Calendar Girls  centres on the Knapeley Womens Institute, a clan of Yorkshire women who meet every week to sing and receive talks on thrilling matters such as carpets and broccoli.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Annie ( Julie Walters ) and Chris ( Helen Mirren ) are long-standing friends who faithfully turn-up, despite the soporific subject matter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When Annies husband dies from leukaemia, the effervescent Chris comes up with the idea of the WI raising money for a new sofa in the hospital in Johns memory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thanks to some creative inspiration from her sons soft-porn magazine and big-breasted dolly-bird on the wall of the local bicycle repair shop, she comes up with the idea of a nude calendar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Whilst most of the group are initially reluctant, the fifty-something middle-class folk are gradually talked round into stripping off ( nude, not naked, Annie is keen to point out ), with their biblical parts ( or front bottoms  if you like ) carefully concealed behind implements traditionally associated with the WI.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, none of them could imagine the impact that the calendar would have over the coming weeks, as it transcends them to superstar status way beyond their village.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, as Hollywood beckons, relationships begin to suffer ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many films based on fact have a tendency to be over-the-top and skew stories so that they are barely recognisable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, it s the films ability to maintain the earthy northern wit and its subtle comedy which really makes it into a winner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The northerness and nudity inevitably leads it to be compared to The Full Monty, but its quirks differentiate it from its predecessor and there does not appear to be an intention to mimic.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Mirren and Walters, surely two of the most talented British actresses of their generation, give great performances and bounce off each other beautifully, easily switching from comedy to drama when required without being hammy and trying too hard.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is particularly interesting that Mirren, best known for her ice-maiden Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect is the bubblier, more outgoing of the pair whilst Walters, Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques  is more reserved.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"John ( played perfectly by Alderton ) is always optimistic and upbeat during his illness, and the scenes with Anne are warm and touching rather than melancholy and melodramatic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a refreshing change from the usual screen morbid portrayals of terminal illness on the big screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rest of the WI is also fabulously portrayed thanks to some great performances from the cast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Annette Crosbie, Celia Imrie and Penelope Wilton all add a nice depth to their characters with some subtle touches.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Complementing each other rather than any one person trying to dominate the screen, the marvellous cast match the playful script.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Chriss sons adolescent awkwardness at her perceived embarrassing behaviour is also quite comedic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One possible criticism would be that the arguments between Anne and Chris in the later stages of the film perhaps seem a little tacked-on to try and create a mini-conflict.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, as youd imagine, it manages to resolve itself before too long and does nt detract from the overall feel-good factor.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A good old-fashioned straightforward plot with the emphasis on script and characters rather than having a deep philosophical meaning, it is fantastically watchable and jam-packed with witty one-liners and should appeal to a wide ranging audience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I caught this movie on the comedy channel today, and want to find it on dvd now, for my collection.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's what I'd term the\" stupid-funny\" style, much like Mel Brooks would make.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you're one of those people that's easily offended by non\"politically correct\" movies, steer clear of this one.","target":"Genuine

details about the movie's plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I just want to be upfront on the following.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I still haven't forgiven Tom for what he did to Nicole.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"To dump your wife through a divorce petition is pretty sleazy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What's even sleazier is to abandon her while she's pregnant with your child and then try to say that the marriage was only enforce for 9 years 11 months so that you could skirt the 10 year California rule on split of assets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's sleazy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about my strong like for Tom Cruise, the actor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've always had a soft spot for the lovable creature that he is and by the time he made Top Gun, I was swearing my undying devotion to him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't think that he's a particularly gifted actor however, like Britney Spears, he is the consummate entertainer.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I doubt that he'll ever win an Oscar for Best Actor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Why?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the end, I think that his looks are what sabotage him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The best thing that could happen to him is an industrial accident.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What does this have to do with The Last Samurai?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'll get to that in a moment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let's review the story, shall we?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's 1876.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The movie opens up with Nathan Algren ( Tom Cruise ) sabotaging his own employment opportunities by funneling his anger and regret into a bottle of alcohol and an attitude of rebellion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What's he so upset about?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As a captain, he spent time fighting those savages and along the way, he massacred innocent women and children.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's enough to make any man with a conscious, drink.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Japanese government, recognizing his keen ability to get the job done, hires him to train their troops in the modern ways of war.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Who is the enemy?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Their own people, specifically those who do not wish to see the modern ways take over their world.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That effort is driven by the samurais and their honorable leader, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Algren, for the right price, takes the job on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Japanese peasants, who make up most of the emperor's army, are ill-prepared for any type of battle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately, the government doesn't want to hear that and despite Algren's proof, they send a group in to hold the samurais back from disturbing a railroad.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"After the samurais kill most of the soldiers ( the others have ran ), Algren is left to fight them off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Katsumoto, impressed and fascinated with the American, spares his life and takes him in as a prisoner.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Algren is housed with the family of the samurai that he killed in battle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"During the process, he detoxes, and learns to appreciate life for what it is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Did you think I just gave the entire movie away?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well relax, I didn't.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So back to this whole thing with Tom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What does his appearance have to do with The Last Samurai?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I felt like the entire time I was watching this movie, that Tom was miscast and had someone else been thrown into this role ( Edward Norton?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hugh Jackman? ),","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I might have walked away liking it better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He was just too pretty for the role.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even the hap-hazard beard and scruff couldn't hide his pretty-boy face and that my friends, was distracting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition, I felt like his acting were pretty stiff.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's like he was aiming to be\"technically\" precise in everything that he did and that in turn seemed to stifle any of his emotional connections with other characters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The true gem of the film, acting wise, was Ken Watanbe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He had a screen presence that I haven't seen in a long time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"His charisma ( magnetic, charming, forceful, and mysterious ) is what pushed me to recommend this movie and I really wish that the entire story would have focused around him and not Tom.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fact, you could have left Tom out of this and it would have been a better picture.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But of course, Tom is the box office pull SO you gotta take the good with the bad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now let's move on to two of my ( normally ) favorite producers/writers/directors in the world - Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I fell deeply in like with them when they were at the helm of Thirtysomething.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I felt cheated that there was a lack of emotional bonding between the characters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I mean, there was some between Algren and Katsumoto ( but not nearly enough ) and virtually nothing but superficial ties with the rest of the characters.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Although I'm thrilled that they didn't have Tom doin' everybody, I felt a little cheated about his interactions with the opposite sex.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This movie was too long ( I had to pee ) and very predictable in parts ( I rolled my eyes ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In addition, for a movie that didn't have enough emotional bonding, it relied a lot on melodrama to manipulate the audience.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"See important death scenes for more details.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The editing together of the scenes was pretty good with the exception of the first 8-10 minutes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The scenes introducing Tom's character felt very disjointed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The technical aspects of the movie - from the cinematography to the battle scenes - were amazing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The fight/training scenes looked real and felt real.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The choreography was over the top fantastic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was duly impressed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The battle scenes seemed more like art than war - almost to the point of glamorization.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Girls, if you strongly dislike blood and guts please know that while there is lots of blood shed, most of the scenes were not horribly gross.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I only closed my eyes twice that I can remember.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As far as the story goes, I can't vouch to any of the historical accuracies of it so if you are one of those sticklers for factual accounts, you might want to do your research before you go.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I feel a little strange giving this movie such low marks considering that it had a some of the best technical stuff I've seen in a long time, a strong score, and Ken Watanabe however, if the studios want to pull in a wider audience than just battle buffs, they need to look beyond the technical perfections and evaluate the emotional aspects of the film.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To recap:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Movie was TOO long.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had to pee but waited.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Tom is too pretty for this kind of role.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Ken Watanabe is a force to be reckoned with.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Boys will like this more than girls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The main problem with The Last Samurai is not that the plot is almost exactly the same as both Dances with Wolves  and Shogun, but that it assumes you ve seen both those movies, and cant seem to decide whether or not it thinks you want to see them again.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you ve seen both the full ten hours of Shogun, and the version where the mini-series is reduced to approximately the length of a feature film, you ve got some idea of whats going in The Last Samurai, and you know that somehow the whole point is lost in the trimming.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You might similarly imagine the version of Dances with Wolves  that has an hour or so cut out of it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now, if you have nt seen either of those films things get a little harder to explain.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Imagine a book whose main purpose is to explore a culture ( to some degree or other ) by way of having an outsider suddenly thrust into it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now imagine that instead of actually having a book like Shogun, with all its details about the culture relayed through the story and the character, you only have the Cliffs Notes of the book which just says, and he explores and comes to know the Japanese culture, and the ways, ideas, and ideals of the Samurai. ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its left to you then to either be able to get something out of that line or not.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Even all this does nt get you to the point that you can really connect with where The Last Samurai is going, because though Dances  and Shogun werent true stories, there was a decent truth  in them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They were fictional stories that attempted to take place in real times, and portray cultures ( to some extent ) as they really were.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Last Samurai is one step removed here, because it is nt a fictional story in that sense.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The historically incorrect things Samurai does are enough to change the entire situation of Japan itself, and change the entire culture to a degree.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Were not across the line into something like alternate-reality sci-fi, but were approaching it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The result is still a trip into the world of Samurai, but it s a trip that says, youve already seen Shogun, so we dont need to go into all that again, and were going down this other road anyway. ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All that said, there are only two things keeping this movie from being not only five stars, but also an instant classic; it s ending ( and I mean the entire last thirty minutes ), and its absolute lack of daring.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Instead of daring, I might actually say its lack of honor ( to itself ), but that is a jaunt toward irony I choose to avoid.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You probably have a good guess at the story based on the comparisons Ive made, and you cant be far off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Captain Nathan Algren ( Tom Cruise ), veteran of the Civil War, and many skirmishes with Indians, is hired to go to Japan and train an army.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He learns that he is there to put down a certain Samurai, Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe ), and his followers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pressured to lead his new troops before theyre ready, he is captured by Katsumoto in the eventual miserable rout his army  suffers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He spends a long winter with Katsumoto and his family in a small village, because Katsumoto wants to know his enemy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once we get beyond how Algren finds his way into the Samurai world, Shogun takes over, complete with a Japanese woman he can grow to love, and surprise night attack by Ninja.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From here we mix equal parts Dances  and Shogun, choosing those elements that best serve the scenario weve created, and we have our plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These three movies may have another connection, because if Kevin Costner, Richard Chamberlain, and Tom Cruise ever did anything right, it was their respective roles in these movies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ive never been a Cruise fan, and even now he feels like an odd choice for the role to me, but he manages it far better than Id have predicted he could.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Thats not to say hes perfect.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Theres still quite a bit of the Hollywood star coming through in his performance, but hes not horrible, and certainly delivers something at least more watchable than his norm.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ken Watanabe, on the other hand, is wonderful.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He delivers a quiet power, and undeniable presence that make you wish all the more that the film came through on its potential.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are a few brilliantly crafted scenes in which Katsumoto is in the background, off-center, and not exactly doing anything.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He is still the absolute center of the scene, and your attention.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its hard to avoid the natural comparison to Shogun here, because though they are very different characters, Watanabe is basically playing Mifunes Shogun role.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thats the sort of situation where a comparison can spring to mind unbidden and wreak unfair havoc with your impression of an actors performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not so here.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"While Watanabe is nt quite going to stand up to a real comparison to Mifune, hes strong enough to at least make such a comparison a respectable question.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mentioning Costner, oddly enough, leads me to the cinematography by Oscar-winner John Toll.","target":"Genuine

stand-point, theyre practically the same movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Theyre beautiful, but it s a very easy sort of beauty.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Panoramic views of rolling plains and hills, sunrises with a hint of cloud cover, and sweeping shots of virgin forest, are not exactly on the cover of  Whats New and Exciting in Beautiful Pictures Monthly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Its gorgeous, sure, but it s not exactly doing anything.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The difference is that when youre making a fairly simple cowboy film whose greatest asset is the fact that it does nt take itself too seriously, that s just the sort of thing that works.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, when youre making a semi-massive epic that puts itself out as having some definite goals, and definitely takes itself very seriously, well..., then it s just a giant-name cinematographer cashing his check and going home early.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of this likely gives an impression which makes my rating confusing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I blame that on expectations, and perhaps a slightly unusual version of them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The mediocre hopes I had for this film built to high hopes as the movie actually progressed before my eyes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At about the halfway mark I was very hopeful indeed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I mentioned that there were two things keeping this from being a five-star movie, and this is where those come into play.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has no real daring to it, even though the first half will lead you to expect some.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Once were a certain amount of the way in ( and even before that really, but you tend to overlook it in the earliest stages of a film ) we realize that everything is given to you in the simplest possible terms, with the least amount of effort, as easily  as can be managed.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other thing keeping the movie from being five-star status is its deplorable ending.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"An ending that is so typically Hollywood that it does its best to negate all that comes before it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its stagy, and manages to avoid being described as formulaic only based on the uninteresting technicality that no ones used the formula before.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Still, Im probably giving a very negative impression of everything to do with this movie that I give four stars ( out of five ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I focus on the negatives, because far too many people are going to sing this movies praises far too much.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It does nt really deserve many nominations, much less the wins it s somewhat likely to receive.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Nevertheless, it s still above-average in my opinion, and though it has a lot going against it, it has a lot going for it as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cruise is nt great, but I have to admit that he is nt bad, and Watanabe alone made it worth it to me.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its certainly entertaining, and has some decent action moments that are actually relevantly connected to the plot.","target":"Genuine

pretty good story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The end result is that I think it s worth your money at the theater.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its greatly disappointing

excellent and fail, and Im not of a mind to change that now.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I should qualify that, because the question of whether or not the creators were actually trying to do something excellent ( as opposed to something that would win awards ) is open to debate, and frankly, Im not sure which side Im on.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Whatever the case

conversation fits my feelings about the movie, because I thought this was going to be a movie about Algrens response, but it turns out it was only about the Emperors initial quesiton.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"OK, I'm not going to lie to you here.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was pretty disappointed with movie in general after watching Bad

negative"},{"sentence":"I'd heard the hype, I'm not opposed to Tim Cruise in general ( even if I did waste seven dollars seeing Vanilla Sky in theaters ), and I went under the impression that after the travesty I'd just seen in Bad Boys II, anything out there would probably be look like Citizen Kane in comparison.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"What I saw instead was an actual contender for best movie of 2003 honors.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Last Samurai is a\"historical\" epic set in the 1870's, as Japan started to move towards joining the ways of the modern ( Western ) world.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As the old ways started to clash with the new ones, the new emperor decides to enlist experts in the Western ways, including Captain Nathan Algren ( played by the aforementioned Tom Cruise ) of the US Army.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Algren, a soldier who's personal demons has driven him to hard times, is brought in to train the Japanese military in the ways of modern warfare.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mind you, this shouldn't be all that hard, as the military is using guns, while the

that vague enough for you? ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ok, let's get started off by saying this is easily one of the top movies of the year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best movie that I have seen so far this year ( mind you, the top two critically acclaimed films of the year, Cold Mountain and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, have yet to be released ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now people who have read my reviews before will know that just last week, I was heaping praise upon Master and Commander.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here's why The Last Samurai is a better picture: Master and Commander is a good movie carried by a great performance by Russell Crowe; Last Samurai is a great film complimented by a great performance by Tom Cruise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Speaking of Cruise, when he decide not to suck?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is probably his most challenging role of his career, and he proved that he was more up to the task.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cruise seemed to immerse himself in the role like I can't remember him ever doing before.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We watch him transform from a drunkard haunted by his past to a warrior who has found peace and redemption for the life he has led.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now while I'm read to throw the guy an Oscar nomination right now, it might just be due to the fact that I've come to expect far less out of him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Regardless, I wouldn't be far off if I said this is one of the his greatest performances.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The rest of the cast is phenomenal, but none greater than Ken Watanabe.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Watanabe plays Katsumoto, the leader of the remaining Samurai who captures and later befriends Captain Algren.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If anyone in the movie gave a better performance than Cruise, it was him.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Throw in a slew of other top performances, and you have quite a nice little pic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What really made this movie for me, though, was its pace and flow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Never slow and never boring, director Edward Zwick manages to find that rare balance between action and drama that all directors strive for, but rarely attain.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's very hard to keep an audience interested in a 144 minute movie from start to finish, but with a stellar storyline and breath-taking scenery, Last Samurai achieves that goal in spades.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On a scale of one to five, Last Samurai is a seven.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This movie gets two thumbs way up from me, and should be in the serious running for an Oscar nomination ( with LOTR:ROTK the clear favorite to win every major award in the world this year, I think a nom is the best that can be hoped for ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I give this movie the highest recommendation, and can lock Last Samurai in as a guaranteed top three movie of the year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Go see this movie.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Admittedly, I was concerned about this film beforehand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While I think Tom Cruise is one of the best mega-star actors Hollywood has to offer, I was concerned that The Last Samurai could do for him what Braveheart did for Mel Gibson and Gladiator did for Russell Crowe: swell their egos past their abilities.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thankfully, this film works well enough by its own right that it does nt have to keep Cruise in the limelight all the time; and hes quite happy to have it that way.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The movie is respectful enough of its subject matter not to put all the glory around its central character and that is what helps this movie to shine.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Last Samurai tells the story of Capt.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nathan Algren ( Cruise ), a courageous American soldier who is plagued by the guilt of a slaughter of innocent Indians ordered by his commanding officer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Using whats left of his fame to sell Winchester rifles, Algren spends his days in solitude drowning in a bottle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That is, until he gets an offer from the Japanese government for $ 500 per week to train their soldiers to fight against a band of Samurai who have rebelled against their quest for modernization.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But it is only after his band of hastily trained soldiers is attacked and Algren is captured by the rebels that he learns of their true fight: to preserve their way of life that is being threatened by western civilization.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Through contact with these enemies  he is able to learn of honor, value and love.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Im sure the cynics will say a movie like this throws the audience into melodrama, but theyll likely say the same about any film in which we are expected to genuinely care about the characters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cruise is a fine lead actor, never stealing the spotlight, but always commanding enough presence for us to believe the film.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And while I was nt always buying him as a genuine Samurai, he throws himself into the role with such determination that he deserves to be commended for his efforts, despite the fact that he is a Hollywood megastar ( which is hard to see past, regardless of how good the performance is. )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Katsumoto, The leader of the Samurai village, is played with an Oscar-worthy performance by Ken Wanatabe, and is easily the films best character.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He is a fierce, honorable warrior, but also a loving leader who seeks to understand that which is outside his culture.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of the films villains, I cant be so praiseworthy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While they do work fine in the framework of the story, they are the same static antagonists we see in every film like this, where their lust for progress  gets in the way of human dignity, although, perhaps this can be blamed on the story itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Dont get me wrong, the story is great.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It works perfectly for the film, because this is a character drama and a war epic, not a story-driven film.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is no need for an overly complex plot, because what were expected to be drawn to here is these people and why theyre so willing to fight for what they believe in.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It may not be wholly original at all, but it works.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And that s all that matters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That being said, the film settles into that mold and shines beautifully.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The environments here are breathtaking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The valley where the Samurai village resides is quite possibly one of the most beautiful set pieces in cinematic history.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its citizens are well portrayed as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These are not savage warriors as the early goings of the film would have us believe, but they are families, fathers fighting to give their children some tradition to cherish.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The costumes are spot on, especially the Samurai armor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When we first meet them thundering through terrestrial mists on horseback, it truly is a fearsome sight.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The film is beautifully scored, from the soft pieces of quiet reflection to the epic pieces of battle, and is probably one of the only soundtracks so far this year that might be worth buying ( Return of the King being the exception ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hans Zimmer captures everything good about the film and translates it musically.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And the fight scenes, oh the fight scenes!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Wow!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The film is intensely violent and has a body count that could rival even Kill Bill.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its not simply all out war, but it s stylistic in its approach as well.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The film has one-on-one sword fighting, finding a windswept and rain-soaked Cruise continually training himself in the way of the Samurai.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a carefully plotted final battle that does nt cheat the viewer by simply having the soldiers run out and kill each other.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Samurai fight for their honor against thousands of Japanese infantry, and the battle is simply spectacular.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is perfectly shot and perfectly directed to an emotional resonance not often found outside something like Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Zwick even respects the intelligence of the viewer by knowing the importance of military strategy in battle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is a truly epic thing to see, with characters we have come to care for fighting for everything they believe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Theres even a scene with Samurai VS Ninjas!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It does nt get much better than that.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"And you can quote me that the final battle here is epic enough that it could rival even Pellannor Fields in Return of the King","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Amidst the battle scenes are long moments of quiet reflection, light humor, and poignant dialogue, all of which serve to draw us further into the story and connect emotionally with the characters.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cruise trains fiercely with the town warriors, refusing to stop until he can no longer move, and earning the respect of the villagers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He becomes a friend to the people, and a father figure to the village children.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In short, he realizes that these people are not the bad guys.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Theyre noble men of good character who only wish to preserve that which they have grown to love.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Katsumoto says to Nathan on the dawn of battle, You think a man can change his destiny?  to which Cruise replies,  I believe a man does what he can, until his destiny is revealed. ","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Good stuff.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Last Samurai is an epic action film that has a heart and a brain.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is intelligence, emotion, humor, and style.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It slows down to let us connect with its characters, and then it throws those characters into a visual orgy of blood and carnage.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The movie conveys the strength of the Samurai and the honor they live by, and the beauty of the ancient Japanese culture.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything about this film is beautiful and I would go as far as to rank it one of the years best films.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I will not rest until I get the word out this is one of the best movies out for 2003!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is not quite perfect, but is the only film I've seen since X2 that succeeds on almost every level it set out to attain.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As I'm not the first review here, everyone should know the story by now.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Cruise is a Civil War hero who drowns his sins liquor every chance he can from the atrocities he has seen and done to the Native Americans.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He gets hired to train a new\"western\" style army for the Emperor of Japan, but gets captured after a failed first attempt at defeating the Samurai rebellion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From there...you'll just have to see the movie!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Honestly I have been looking forward to this movie for about a year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I forced my reluctant wife ( who had no interest ) to see it, and she left the theatre happily surprised.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For me who had such high expectations this did not disappoint.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The story, I must say, is fictional.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So please disregard all those'not historically correct' complaints you may read.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The director has said upfront they tried to be extremely accurate on all things for that era, but the story is not a true one.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yes it does have its predictable moments, but for me this did not distract from enjoying an epic tale.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Costumes will win an Oscar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These are by far the most exquiste creations I've seen all year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Of course I'm talking about the Samurai armor first and foremost.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although we see Cruise's on all the promotional material, his is not the best you've seen yet.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Acting wise, Cruise stays on top of his game, no I don't think it is\" Oscar-worthy\" despite the amount of training he did for the role, but he really hasn't been better.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My 3 favorite performances of his were from Jerry Maguire, Minority Report, and Interview with the Vampire, and this movie falls right in line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He does perform a good character transition from his tortured past to his appreciation and earnest learning of the Samurai way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many of the other supporting characters were also very good, but I could see Ken Watanabe being nominated as he delivers a wide range from a warrior's strength to a father's compassion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There were plenty of masterfully crafted ( physical ) special effects, but were there any visual effects?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I honestly couldn't say.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes, most certainly, but they are so well conceived I felt I've seen the first action (epic )movie that looked entirely real and natural....in a long time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How can I not be blow away from the intense battle scenes!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We have Samurai in full gear fighting, we have Ninjas!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( Yes as lethal as you can imagine. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Never have you seen the Samurai sword wielded with such amazing skill...by everyone in this film.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The choreography of these fights (especially the opening attack and Ninja raid ) are breathtaking.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Actually as\" cool\" as this can be, the grisly deaths should leave you feeling a bit uneasy about what it means to kill another person and how utterly horrible war can be and the devestation it leaves, unless you're completely de-sensitized.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Last but not least I shouldn't forget to mention the gorgeous cinematagraphy and score.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Here we see more, and new beautiful venues of the New Zealand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I truly believe I was looking at ancient Japan, as it once was.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If anything go see the movie just to witness its jaw-dropping landscapes!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am a big fan of Hans Zimmer as I have both his Black Hawk Down and Gladiator scores.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He does such a well job of blending in the grand with the eclectic you always get something new for each endeavor.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here will be the next soundtrack I purchase.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the first time in awhile I actually experienced the music in a film as much as the film itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The main theme had the spirit of a Gladiator or Last of the Mohicans, but obviously with a Far East influence.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was a lush, rich, emotionally charged piece of music.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The one caveat I had is the ending.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It lost the movie momentum, felt wishy-washy and rushed to clear up all possible lose ends of the story.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The writers didn't know how to properly close it so they stamped it with the all too typical\"hollywood hero\" end.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Spoiler.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Skip ahead now!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Begin Rant...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How ridiculous is it every Samurai gets killed on the battlefield except Algren, especially when they let loose the heavy artillery on the charging Samurai.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pretty lame the way he only gets hit a few times, and I would say minor recoverable wounds at best, in relation to every other warrior getting riddled with lethal hits.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"End Rant...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"End Spoiler","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Regardless of a couple faults this is one of the most beautifully shot, emotionally-invested, incredibly detailed movie of the year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Reviewers Note: I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I was allowed, 1/2 star deduction for the ending.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Edited ( 12/12/03 ) to correct the mistakes in my rant after a 2nd viewing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you've been alive for the last 15 years or so, you would have at some point encountered MC Hammer's smash hit single U Can't Touch This.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Based upon the bass guitar riff from Superfreak, the jivey little number was a massive hit worldwide, and was once voted the greatest song of the 1980's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It appears to appeal to just about everybody: no matter which audience I play it to, it seems to go down well amongst everybody.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Accompanying this ditty was the album Please Hammer Don't Hurt Em, in which MC Hammer takes a stand against all the issues of the day.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Basically, this is the quintessential rap album of the age.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the liner notes, as with most of the disc, he rants about racial discrimination and a mixed bag of other capitalist society flaws.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even when the album gets cheesily bad, it's still fun in a very 80's way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You will find yourself grooving to songs you know you hate, just for the retro effect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In the fun little intro Here Comes The Hammer, he raps about the album you're about to experience in what is basically the bridge to U Can't Touch This.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After that track comes the slow moving romantic number Have You Seen Her?, the only one of it's type on the album.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yo!! Sweetness with a rather redundant second exclamation mark, is a very beat-heavy ( hell, the whole album is beat-heavy ) track with men chanting about a sweetness  across the room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On Your Face, Dancing Machine, Pray, Crime Story and Black Is Black are exactly the same: like Janet Jackson in Rhythm Nation 1814, MC Hammer complains about all the difficulties facing modern Western society, racial discrimination in particular, to way too many beats and fairly crappy lyrics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He even contributes a series of preachy poems to the booklet about these topics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Shes Soft And Wet and Work This are also the same: Theres a girl.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Shes hot, eh? Yes, she is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She certaintly is.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let me explain why this is so.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, should you buy Please Hammer, Dont Hurt Em?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While it s one of the essential rap albums of the day, it comes across very dated and cheesy, so No.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, if you can get your hands on Please Hammer at garage sale prices, or a single of U Cant Touch This, make sure to pick it up: Cant Touch is a must-have for every music collection!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"#NAME?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Remix albums are usually pointless exercises by a record company to bleed loads of money out of unsuspecting fans and into pockets of artists-and moreso, the labels themselves.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since the remix album exploded in 1989-90 with the likes of Bobby Brown, Paula Abdul and the New Kids, there haven't been many remix albums that are not average, at best.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now St. Louis rapper nelly joins the fray with his clunkily titled\" The Derrty Versions: The Reinvention\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is basically a souped-up greatest hits album.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While some of his hits enjoy a slight adjustment in beat, none of these songs is extraordinarily different than te original version, which is a good and a bad thing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you're a Nelly fan, you're getting jerked out of your money to get a buncha stuff you already own.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you're like me and think the man has a couple of hot singles, it's an OK buy because it means you don't have to buy either of his middling-to-weak albums.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'll be the first to admit I'm not a Nelly hater, but he grew on me very slowly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I respect the dude because he has his own style, and he's not afraid to admit that he's not the greatest MC in the world, but he has his own little niche.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Of course, his success far outweights his artistry, but how many artists can we say that of?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"hey, the dude wants to make you dance, he's relatively inoffensive, he doesn't traffic into the super-violent and misogynist cliches that most other popular MC's fall into.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Hey, no one will ever confuse him with Rakim, but he's OK, damn it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Some of the remixes leave very little unchanged from the original version.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Country Grammar\", Nelly's breakout hit, is exactly the same as the original version with one minor alteration in the chorus as well as a verse from E-40, the hip-hop king of\"what the f*** is that dude saying?\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Dilemma\" and\" Work It\" add slightly harder beats ( courtesy of Jermaine Dupri and Scott Storch ) respectively.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"JD brings up Nelly's vocal, which is almost buried into the mix on\" Dilemma's\" studio version, while Nelly alters his flow on\" Work It\", which was originally a pretty decent party anthem but now is only interesting because of Justin Timberlake's best Michael Jackson impression to date.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" E.I.\" is remixed by crunk king David Banner, and Banner's rock-etched production is the standout on a couple of tracks here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He takes it back to the old-school Rick Rubin Casio-drumbeat and loud guitar days on this one, despite its' somewhat sexist refrain of\"is that yo' a** cuz it ain't yo face\" plastered throughout the song.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For whatever reason, it appears twice on this set.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The album's two best songs are the most chilled-out tracks here, giving Nelly more of an RandB than a hip-hop vibe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Pimp Juice\" coasts along on a jazz-kissed soul background with some sultry sax and a guest vocal by the legendary Ron Isley.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"\" Groovin' Tonight\" is all about Brian McKnight's great guest vocal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You almost forget that there's rapping on this track ( not to mention a samle of the opening drumbeat of Michael Jackson's\" Rock With You\" ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, that's about it for the good stuff here.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Neptunes severely bland\" If\" segues into an unnecessary remix of\" Hot In Herre\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Originally produced by The\"tunes also, this remix is helmed by Nelly's in-house production team, and doesn't really change the song a whole lot.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"\" Ride Wit Me\" is the weirdest remix of all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How many hip-hop albums do you know that feature a shout out to my\" n*gga John Mayer\"?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This reconstruction liberally lifts from mayer's breakout hit\" No Such Thing\", and while it's weird to hear Nelly twisting the melody of Mayer's hit, some experiments are best left untried.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This

not too bad and they manage to fit within the music in the background.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This track is more of a rock-rap mixture, and not just hip-hop music.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Ill give the Neptunes credit, they are great at experimenting with new styles and blending styles and being creative, but they need to knock out the commercial crap.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I suggest skipping\" Rock n Roll\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even though the beat is worth listening to, the rapper Fam-Lay is the worst emcee ive heard thusfar on this album, yes hes worse than Nelly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fam-Lay's lyrics are among the worst ever, as he spits uninspired, whack-a** lyrics, with a vocabulary matching that of an unborn child, and a choppy flow.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Fam-Lay raps about money and drugs as every rapper does, but he

chorus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beat thankfully stays the same, with that epic piano and trumpet medley which is definetely head-knodding and one of the best Neptunes beat ever.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lyrics in my opinion, are watered-down on this version, with less memorable punchlines and less witty clever flows.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Clipse stays with their slightly above average performance, but the guests get a tad bit on the annoying side.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was smart to put this track on this album, since it'll definetely help sell the album.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Noreaga and Pharrell drop by to make an absolutely terrible clubbish song\" Put Em

triumphant return.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"His lyrics are, as expected, insane!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"ODB is truly back, as he spits exactly the same as he did

maybe even improved a tiny bit since his last outing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Engaged to be Married couple Nas and Kelis ( I think they're engaged ) finish off the album with the terrible\" Popular Thug\", which is a huge dissapointment for a Nas fan like myself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This track sounds as if it was seemingly pulled right out of

are admittedly nice, but boring at the same time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The song has a unique feel when it comes to production, as the Neptunes give us a semi-clubbish RandB beat, with guitars, synthesizers, and organ piano.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However Nas ( incredibly enough ), has made this track unlistenable, with his terrible lyrics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only thing Clones has going for itself is the beats.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Neptunes, though commercial, are very good producers and skilled at making unique beats with extraordinary sounds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unfortunately for them, their choice of emcees is somewhat limited, as they seemingly choose and sign some of the worst lyricists in the game.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sad thing is, even when they bring Nas along, who is one of the greatest of all time, even he f*cks it up with his sell-out mentality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would've preferred that this album be more of an instrumental piece than a showcase of artists.","target":"Genuine

more than this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"1 Star","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Neptunes made the album I always wished P.

decent for dancing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Track 7 - Hands in da Air","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A song with Mystikal, this is horrible.","target":"Genuine

boring.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is no goodfor dancing because it's too slow - too fastr for grinding!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"haha.","target":"Genuine

when they are heard, they aren't great.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The lyrics have no real point to them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is ok for dancing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Track 15 - Pink Limonade","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The tune is barely there - another one of those 2-note melodies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This has a dull sound, but then when you hear DaBrat's voice, it makes you want to cringe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is ok for dancing, although I wouldn't ever get up and dance to this one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Track 16 - Bishop Don Juan","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another phone call

crossed Michael Jackson with Eve.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The tune sounds so retrospective - 80's or early 90's - and the lyrics are so\" today\" that it sounds ridiculous.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not only that, as you can see, all her songs don't have much of a theme or point to them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They don't seem to be well thought out.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It seems to me like she is merely rapping just because.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No reason!","target":"Genuine

buy Missy instead.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I first started listening to rap in the early 1990s, when members of my peer group, Kris Kross were the hottest act going.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was obvious that the 2 kids in Kris Kross had no talent whatsoever, just used as marketing objects to make rap appeal to the young crowd in America.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The idea with Kris Kross was to give them a squeaky clean image, with a thugged out look and sound.","target":"Genuine

to do with Shyne?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Absolutely nothing, that was a brief introduction to a situation that occurs in rap known as being a\" studio gangsta\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Studio gangstas are the lowest form of human beings in the rap game.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Shyne falls into the category of studio gangsta, because he claims he was a poor kid on the streets of Brooklyn, who never sold a record in his life.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yet he has a song on his album called\" That's Gangsta\", quite possibly the worst rap song of all time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's Gangsta has Shyne bsing the rap world about he is a true street thug, he's dodged the cops, and he has 100 carats in his watch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If Shyne has 100 carats in his watch, before he had a job, and he got it from street hustling, the FBI would investigate the purchase of

deeper into speaking of this horrible fraudulent piece of rap music, I will go on to his next song, and equally deplorable attempt to try and tell you Shyne is something he's not.","target":"Genuine

C underground release brought me to believe that Shyne had no future, and my instincts were correct.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Bad Boy is nothing more than a sappy attempt to convince the American hip hop listening audience that Shyne is more than just a rapper, he had to earn his keep on the streets, and he is still doing so.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Don't fall for it, Shyne is nothing more than a really bad actor, and a pathetic attempt to match the superior lyrical stylings, of one, Biggie Smalls.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Perhaps what is considered one of the worst publicity stunts of all time, and the stupidest career move Shyne could make, Shyne was indicted for the infamous club shooting at a party, thrown by the head of Bad Boy Records, Puff Daddy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To pump the upcoming debut of Shyne's album, it was rumored that Shyne was the shooter in this party, the one that Puffy and Jennifer

to make him millions because his record will be sent straight to the top through his promotions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Puff also takes Shyne in despite his ongoing fued with long time friend and partner Lil Kim.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, Shyne, the shooter?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think not, just a shameless attempt to push an album that has no reason to ever be shelved.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Shyne is one of the great travesties of rap music.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He has a horrible voice for the business, a look similar to that of Warren G, who hasn't been popular since the mid 90's, and is obviously just a cheap Biggie imitation.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If it was up to me, his album wouldn't even go double wood, but it has sold somewhere in the area of almost reaching gold status, which is pretty pathetic.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I think if

been one to get offended by profanity in music.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A lot of my favorite artists use profanity in their lyrics.","target":"Genuine

technique.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Big Tymers sprinkle curse words in their lyrics in places where not only is it not necessary, but it detracts from the rhythm.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Instead of the lyrics flowing, as with Ice Cube or Dr Dre, Big Tymers' lyrics have a stutter quality to them that makes listening to the songs unenjoyable.","target":"Genuine

yet.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They've put profanity and insults in their music in places that would have flowed much better without them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This was proven by watching the video for\" Get Your Roll On\" on BET.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lyrics in the video flowed and between that and the beat, I couldn't just sit and watch.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had to get up and dance in front of the TV.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beats and rhythm on the CD are still booming, and such that you will want to dance to them and bob your head to the music.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But if you're like me, you will wish there was a switch on your stereo that would allow you to cut the lyrics out and just listen to the rhythm.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The feel I got from this album is that Big Tymers were trying to copy Ice Cube and Dr Dre and other Gangsta Rappers' styles, and failed miserably.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you like Gangsta and Hardcore Rap, read my review of Ice Cube's new album,\" War and Peace: Vol 2 ( The Peace Album )\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My recommendation on this album,\" I Got That Work\" by Big Tymers, is either get the edited version, or just pass it

extremely misogynistic track that s hidden in a glossy, acoustic guitar laced beat along with Lil Mo and Mike Shorleys strong singing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Bad B*tch also borrows rhymes from another album.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This time it s from The Clipse song, Lets Talk About It.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The lyrics are along the lines

positive"},{"sentence":"Up On Things presents nothing new or exciting, but the piano driven, synth backed beat is very infectious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Snoop Dogg shows up for the chorus and some extremely pointless lyrics, but his presence is refreshing in a self-parody sort of way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This Is My Party just plain sucks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The beat is horrible, Fabolous  rhymes are weak, and the chorus is completely and utterly wack!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Skip at all costs!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ashanti stars on Into You, an attempt of introspection that goes horribly wrong.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Apparently, Fab is attempting to be real with a girl, but all he does is talk about how much money he has and how hes greater than anyone else.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What is this crap?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Essentially, it would be a waste of time for me to continue my review, considering the fact that the rest of the songs follow the same routine of recycled subject matter, beats, and complete lack of talent/creativity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seems to me that this entire album is just a lame attempt at making money.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Every track is below average.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If Fabolous does nt step up his game and does nt drops the clichs, hes never

very little similarity, if you haven't you have issues.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The difference between Shyne and Biggie, besides the younger and healthier voice of Shyne, is that Biggie was a studio gangsta' where as Shyne is for real.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Biggie even said it himself in an interview, he sits with friends and takes their experiences and

that's high energy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the beat feels goofy to me, but i still like the song as a whole.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"i think it's one of the top

don't know why, but i think it's just too slow of a beat underneath funky flows.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"15. never duplicated: a cool lil song to bump in the ride or a party, has a bit of neptunes sounds in it, which always makes songs better.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"i think if anyone says his flows are better on this album, a lot of it is on this song.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"17. my life: a classic 90's sounding song featuring mary j. blige on the ENTIRE chorus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"sounds like j.

tries to connect with his deceased friends.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With complex, emotional lyrics that are as simplistic as they can be incredibly deep rhyme-wise, you can never say Cormega isn't emotionally honest.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With each bar he comes off as pained and regretful, as many of us are after we've lost a loved one.","target":"Genuine

positive"},{"sentence":"Emotionally lyricism is one thing, but crafting a great beat over poetic lyrics that craft more emotion than the production itself is stellar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Without a doubt the introspection here is one of the many stand-outs on The Realness.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The following track, Glory Days, shines because of its original and extremely well-produced beat and it's retrospective, professional lyricism.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After that particular track, we come to another outstanding moment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Rap's A Hustle is an original metaphorical track that uses the idea of pimping for emceeing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"' Mega's pen is the prostitute and he is the pimp; this is an extremely original idea in and of itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It doesn't come as any surprise that the production is stellar.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over a scarce drum loop, airy sound effects and a keyboard-style background that gets your head nodding immediately, he kicks his original subject matter with no faltering moments.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"He drops the poetic elements for more Old School-styled lyricism which is slightly simplistic in the rhyme department but just listening to his great use of metaphors is a great listen in and of itself.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As well, over a beat that is near perfect in every aspect makes the track all the much better; without a doubt this extremely fresh view of Hip-Hop is something that more Hip-Hop needs to utilize.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You Don't Want It follows later on in the album and is a better example of the battle raps you'll find throughout The Realness.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Much in the same vein as Get Out My Way but lighter in tone,' Mega spews venom and Nas and everyone of his other peers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over a piano arrangement and a light drum loop,' Mega drops insult and truthful statements to verbally attack Nas with multi-syllabic rhymes and a scheme that is both complex and on-point flow-wise.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Without a doubt this even outweighs Nas' diss to' Mega, Mobb Deep and Nature with Destroy and Rebuild from Stillmatic simply because he doesn't use typical battle tactics but instead uses the honest truth.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This approach is something not many chose to use.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"' Mega doesn't resort to immature insults but relies on great lyricism and valid points to explain the situation with Nas, and belittle him.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"( You wanna talk violent, but Sig P.'s for solution/ I stalk silent, when I proceed

negative"},{"sentence":"Even with the album appearing done, after about two minutes of waiting after the Fallen Soldiers ( Remix ) ends, another track starts up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"An ominous background starts up over a dark bass line, the sound of a record popping and low vocals darken the track all the much more.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Killaz Theme II is and outstanding track, so it comes as a surprise that it s a bonus track and is nt included in the track listing.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Both member of Mobb Deep appear on this track and assist Cormega on dropping some extremely dark, ominous lyrics about the true reality of the streets with a hardcore edge.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All three give a great performance with their own distinct flows and subject matter for this particular topic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although it s not officially the album closer, the lyrics themselves leave a lasting impression and leave the album on an extremely good note.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is one of the greatest albums of all time; I would even go as far as to say it's the modern day Illmatic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Out of every one of the fourteen tracks, none of them approach being weak and are all stellar.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Cormega sticks to the streets here and never approaches selling out, which means

doesn't talk about shooting someone or treating your woman like garbage, or it is too political.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This album is somewhere between the two extremes, and I have actually used this album to get some of my friends to start giving some records a chance even though they are not what everyone talks about and aren't on MTV and BET everyday.","target":"Genuine

this setting-setter, we get Get Free.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here, Rasco uses Alcatraz to symbolize two separate things.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, he uses it to urge people to\"escape\" from whatever is holding them back in life.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The second meaning is more personal, which is his own struggles with his previous

setbacks is U Got The Time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Over a relaxing, soulful guitar loop, his verses flow easily on this uplifting song.","target":"Genuine

gansta beat of all time coming from one of the greatest, 2pac, from his\" Ambition as a Rider\" hit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It very dangerous to sample one of the best beats of all time, Cam did the beat some justice though, he ripped it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Song Rating: 4 1/2 Microphones","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"5 ) DAYDREAMING - This is an awful thug love song.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"He comes nowhere close to Jigga's\" Song Cry.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has entirely too much singing and only a couple short verses, it definitely has no playtime in my player.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Song Rating: 1 1/2 Microphones","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"6 ) COME HOME WITH ME- This is a song where Cam shows off some of the skills of his Dip Set peeps.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is not a song that will knock you off your feet, but the lyrics was nt all that bad because they all had a couple of good punch lines, so it is not all that bad, but the beat is annoying.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Song Rating: 3 Microphones","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"7 ) WELCOME TO NEW YORK CITY- Now Cam is getting the meat of the album, JAY-Z, good move by Cam to get label mate and legendary rapper Jay-Z on the track.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are discussing their stomping grounds and I love it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is definitely the best song on the album, and what I think should have been the first single, but Cam came hard with the lyrics, and Jay-z always does so in my estimation, this is a hit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Song Rating: 5 Microphones","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"8 ) HEY MA - We all know this as the second single off the album, but it is not that bad.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The beat is crazy and it fits perfectly with the mood of the song as a whole.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The video is even better with one-legged Frankie with Gucci crutches throws a crutch away and starts c-walking, very creative and humorous.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The song has a good hook but the lyrics were a little too basic and nursery rymish.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Song Rating: 3 1/2 Microphones","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"9 ) ON FIRE TONIGHT- Well, now we see a little bit of the Dip Sets hype man, Freaky Zekey in Action, the skit before the song where he talks about a female burning  him ( for you all who dont know what burning is, it is women having a STD, and a man having intercourse with her without a condom on ) and he makes it funny to get burnt.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Cam goes in and talks about that touchy situation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its Funny!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Song Rating: 4 Microphones","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"10 ) STOP CALLING - This a song that I believe to be even funnier.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a song that starts off with a man callin Cam to ask him di he f*** his girl, and Cam plays with him and asks him whos your girl, then Cam starts rapping on the situation and all that he and his crew did to her, for example:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, I'ma tell you straight up, homeboy cause it's a cold

Microphones","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Reasons to buy:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"1. Originality","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2. Personality of Cam","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are certain things that just can't be touched.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One of those things just happens to be Da Brat's current album\" Unrestricted.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On this album she proves to be more talented and in touch with who she really is compared to\" Anutha Tantrum\" and\" Funkdafied.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Her singles have become more than just songs that one hears on the radio, but instruments that we wake up and sing, get crunk, or relate our everday lives to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It may not be suitable for those 14 years and under due to the explicit content, but with anthems such as\" That's What I'm Lookin For,\" Da Brat is bound for success.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Da Brat does have her PG-rated comments leaving her to restrict some of her audiences.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With titles such as\" Whatchu Like,\" F**k You,\" and\" All My B*tches,\" it isn't surprising that some parents are forbidding their children from listening her songs in their homes.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The fact that she has this PG-rated edge shows that she has matured since Funkdafied, thus, leaving her to gain a new audience ( the more mature ) to almost replace the younger.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Her album is pure evidence that female artists/rappers have their work cut out for them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Da Brat is, somewhat of, a genius with her beats and lyrics ( that everyone is\"biting\" ) She is proving to be more competition than anyone ever perceived.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Jermaine Dupri ( CEO of SoSoDef Productions )definitely saw talent in her soul when he picked her up out of Chi-Town.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Hopefully, Da Brat will continue on her journey of what she perceives as success, proving to J.D., her family, and her world of fans that she definitely is unrestricted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Da Brat~one of the most original rap and RandB stars out there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She has the funky sass of a rap star, and the elegant class of a woman.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Her new cd attracted me from the song\" That's What I'm Looking For.\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It had an amazing beat, cool words, and the music video showed many sides of Da Brat.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Her growing up from the young disobedient thug girl, to now a woman, is definitely showed throughout her album.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With appearances by Tyrese, JD and Lil John, Ja Rule..and many other great performers, her cd is hard to not listen to repeatedly.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Her flows and technique is far different from her other albums.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She has matured, as well as her music and lyrical talent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"She still holds it down as one of the strongest and outspoken ladies of the hip-hop world today.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If CDs full of energy is\"what you're looking for\", I would recommend artists such as Dr. Dre, Eminem, Ja Rule, and The Cash Money Crew, and Eve.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you liked her before, you'll like her now.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So go out and by the CD, you won't regret it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm a big fan of Panasonic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Their products are well designed and well built.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's probably why the KX-TG5100M 5.8 GHz phone system was a disappointment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First problem: Sound quality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Memory chips are inexpensive, but Panasonic saved money by putting a small memory chip in this system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Compression technology is utilized to fit 15 minutes of recorded messages onto the chip, and you can tell -- sound quality is AWFUL.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ironically, the best sound quality comes from the old analog answering machines that still use cassette tapes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( So much for technological advance. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Second problem: The power pack consists of three cheap NiCd AA batteries encased in plastic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even worse, they're very low capacity NiCds -- just 850 mAh.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"( NiCd is the old technology for rechargeable batteries.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cadmium is a nasty environmental toxin.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"NiCd batteries drain quickly, even when not in use, and they have a\"memory effect\": If you don't drain the power completely before a recharge, they'll only charge up to the current level on the next charge. )","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The phone handset only works a few hours before recharging is needed, and storing it on the charger base will significantly reduce the life of the batteries.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If Panasonic had opted for the current technology of 2200-mAh NmH ( nickel metal hydride ) batteries, the 4-hr usage time could have been boosted to 10 hrs or more, with no memory effect.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Enough cost cutting, Panasonic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you're going to charge people so much for a product, build it with quality components.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Third problem: You have to endure a goofy voice that tells you things that could be more efficiently conveyed through visual indicators.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I suppose an electronic voice is Panasonic's way of adding a\" Gee-wow\" factor, but it's another example of how new technology makes our lives less efficient.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Older answering machines have an LCD display that tells you how many new messages you have.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This machine has just a tiny red light, so if you call-screen a message and don't erase it, you have no idea whether other messages have been added (unless you start pushing buttons ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You have to waste time pressing buttons and listening to the voice every time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, you have to press extra buttons like Mailbox 1 every time, even though you never use other message\"mailboxes\" (used for password-protected messages that can be storage for other users of the system ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"More gripes: The antennas on the base unit are five inches high.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They get in the way.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, you can't hear your own voice in the handset, as you can with other phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It takes a while to get used to that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, the handset is fairly bulky and heavy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the plus side, the range of a 5.8 GHz phone is fairly good ( although quality does degrade with distance ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I still worry about zapping my brain with high-energy radio signals, but going cordless is nice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Wish list: In addition to fixing the above-mentioned gripes, it would be great if there were a way to speed through boring messages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My old digital answering machine allowed me to increase the talking speed 1.3x and 1.6x, in addition to jumping back in 5-second intervals and slowing down the recorded message ( all without changing the pitch, and all controlled by a simple, intuitive jog dial ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Panasonic does allow you to slow down the message playback, but that's it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm kind of disappointed this expensive phone system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I used to have a Siemen's phone system, but the sound started to degrade after a few years, so I switched to this more expensive Panasonic system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phone has a nice feeling to it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I like that you can choose the line you want to dial out on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This feature was missing from the Siemens phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The illuminated keypad works very well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The volume control is easy to use when talking, but I wish it went a bit louder.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sometime it's just not enough volume.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now for the down side.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The directory is not connected to the caller-id like on my cell phone, and my Siemens phones.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"What I mean by this is if a name exists in my directory with a phone number, I want that directory name to display instead of the default caller-ID name.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sometimes the caller-ID name is\" Unknown Name\", like every time for cell phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That doesn't do me any good at all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Transfering is difficult on this phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can't just yell across the house\" Pick up the phone\".","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You have to transfer the call.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is not always easy, because you have to ask what number extension are you holding.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are no labels on the extensions, just numbers.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I don't like the fact that each phone acts like it's a stand alone phone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The system does not act like a system.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can't share directories.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This is a big minus, because you have to type in the directory for each phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have about 75 numbers, and names for a system of 4 phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can't clear the\" Received Calls\" label for the system.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"What's the point of buying a system, when the phones don't share.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There is no mute button on the base, or any of the handsets.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The speakerphone does work well though.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We had central air installed in our house, and it seems that the blower is interfering with the sound quality of any handset that gets within 10 feet of it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Upside again:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I do use the general mailbox.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That works well, and I can access it from the road.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can have multiple mailboxes, but I just use the general box.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"the phone uses NiMH batteries, and that's good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No interference from my wireless video camera, wireless computer network, or microwave.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"No audio chopping when I move to distant parts of the house - I did have these problems at 2.4 GHz.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I first tried a Uniden DCT-5260, 2.4 GHz model with 2 handsets - I don't see that model on ePinions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I like the orange backlight and lack of visible antenna.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have nothing else good to say about it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The function keys are atrocious.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can find the Talk button easily, but the End button is just one of 6 identical buttons that are equally spaced around the large talk button.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What were they thinking?!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To work with the caller ID list you have to press a button on the left, then one of two buttons on the right to scroll, then down to the bottom to use two poorly labelled buttons: one to delete, the other to confirm?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most other phones - including the DCT-5260 - will use soft keys.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What were they thinking?!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When the phone is taken out of the charging cradle the LCD blanks out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It does activate when a call comes in, but on the DCT-5260 it stays on ( but not lit ) so that you can glance at it and see if there are any new calls on the list.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With this phone you have to press a button to reactivate the screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't get it, LCD with light off consumes very little power.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"What were they thinking?!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The DCT-5260 used AA NiMH batteries.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What a GREAT IDEA!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But this newer model uses a proprietary and smaller set of NiMH.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What were they thinking?!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Storing numbers from caller ID was not easy, especially because the function keys required are scattered all over.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I know I could've read the manual, but try to do this common function on a Nokia cell phone and you'll NEVER need the manual.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Imagine my dismay when I realized that long distance caller ID numbers can NOT be redialed!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yes, they left off the leading 1 (one ) and there's no option to make it store numbers with a 1.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Finally, although the handset looks OK, I despised the retro base station look, so I made sure to buy the basic model with no speakerphone or answering machine.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Uniden needs to put a 5.8 GHz phone in the DCT-5260 package.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now that I've concluded this review I realize that I must return the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Stupidity should not be rewarded","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Pros: decent speaker phone","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cons: short battery life breaks easily paint scratches off sounds horrible","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had one for 3 months, and I just threw it away.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It had poor sound quality from day 1, and everyone was always complaining to me that they couldn't hear my voice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Later on, the phone shorted out and the only way it would work reliably is in speaker phone mode.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, the fancy painted plastic quickly started looking really bad, as the silver paint scratched easily (especially around the ear area ) and left ugly black marks on the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Suddenly, the phone looks really really cheap.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Battery life was about 2 hours of talk time, which is ok but you can do better with 2.4ghz or 900mhz phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm back to an older generation 900mhz phone now, and the voice quality is much better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pros: Great unless you're more than 10 feet away.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cons: Interface not intuitive, reception horrible,","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"These phones were purchased to replace a similar Vtech set and there is no comparison between the 2 systems.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Uniden phone system all the same features I was looking for, but in comparison, the Uniden phones weren't at ALL intuitive, I was constantly referring to the manual and the reception was just simply horrible.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As the headline states, I just unloaded my Unidens on E-Bay for about half of what I paid and replaced them with another, comparible Vtech set.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"By the way, if you are in the market for cordless units, you can't go wrong with the Vtech units.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I would post a review touting my appreciation of my new Vtech units, but at this time they aren't listed on epinions.com.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"About 20 years ago I had purchased Uniden cordless phone and despite the extra long telescopic antenna, I couldn't get more than 10 ft from the base.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But that was 1982 and no cordless phone worked perfect.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Over the years I witnessed new phones showing up on the market.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So when I noticed this technological marvel with 5.4GHz frequency and very attractive silver finish, I immediately assumed that it must be better phone than my worn out Panasonics.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The claim printed right on the front of the package\"introducing the most powerful phones ever built\" assured me that I'm buying a quality product.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phone has great features.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I like the push to talk option and 2 handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phone looks really great but it just doesn't work well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At about 60 ft from the base you can hear static and about 100 ft away from the house conversation becomes impossible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Per instructions, I relocated base away from any possible interference, but this little beauty just didn't work.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My 900 MHz Panasonic costing $ 29.99 has more than double the range and there is virtually no static 200 ft away.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My old 2.7GHz 4-line Panasonic also outperforms Uniden by far.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This great looking Uniden reminds me of the crappy phones from the 80's.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't waste your time calling Uniden cusomer service.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The so called\"technician\" will read from the book about microwave ovens, computers and fluorescent lighting interfering with your phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The guy is very rude and keep pausing for a minute at the time and than tells me that I have a bad phone line in my house.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All other phones work just fine from the same line and so does Uniden when you're 20 ft away from the base.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Don't waste your time and money on this inferior product.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Pros","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"5.8Ghz, ringtones, lightweight","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cons","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cuts out, battery doesn't seem to be completely efficient","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Bottom Line","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would be wary of this product unless you know someone who has one that has performed well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Full Review","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So I was looking for phones some time before Thanksgiving last year and settled on trying to find Uniden phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mostly because they had what I was looking for and they were fairly stylish and cheap.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I ended up getting the Uniden TRU-5865 2 pack which has a main cordless phone with a usable speakerphone base ( that plugs into a wall outlet and phone jack ) and then a satellite base and cordless receiver which only plus into the wall outlet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let it be known, that I purchased this product off of eBay and that it was a new, refurbished model.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I charged the phones up for the suggested time before we started using them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then I transfered the phone list from our old phones to the new phones ( manually of course ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We were pretty happy with the phones at first, just the initial excitement of having something new and different.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, it seemed as though the batteries were not holding charge very well.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Then we also started noticing that the phone would cut out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You could still talk and the person on the other end could hear you but you could not hear them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is a good thing we kept our old 2.4Ghz phones because that is what we are currently using.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"These two problems have caused me to get rid of the Uniden phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phones themselves were comfortable to hold, came with belt clips which were handy, and had different ringtones ( which we had wanted ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, the inability to use the phone without knowing whether it was going to cutout or not caused all the pros of this product to diminish.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is fair enough to say this may have been a lemon that was supposed to have been repaired to great condition, although the cutting out did not occur for the first couple months.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"But even so, what does that say about the service and warranty work about Uniden products?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, when I purchase more phones I will most likely not be going with Uniden.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have had good experience with Panasonic and while they are expensive I would like something that works and is reliable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here are some of the details regarding these Uniden phones:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- 5.8 Ghz DSS technology","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- Up to 2 cordless handsets on same\"network\"","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"#NAME?","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"#NAME?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- 10 speed dial numbers","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- up to 100 phonebook numbers able to be stored","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- battery is supposed to last up to 192 hours standby and 4 hours of talk time","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- has a 1 year warranty except refurbished items only have 90 days","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"- i believe there are 10 different ringtones/rings you can choose from... a few classical type song ringtones, we wish you a merry christmas, etc","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There you have it, now you have all the information regarding this phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have not had any other contact with Uniden products and this admittedly leaves a bad taste in my mouth.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My brother just bought some new Uniden phones and I am looking forward to seeing what his experience is with them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Happy hunting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pros: Easy to find Talk button.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cons: Sound quality is bad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have tried this model of cordless phone by Uniden and have brought it back twice to the store because the sound does not work on one of the phones.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The volume cuts out when you are talking to someone and then you have to hit it to get it to come back on, which didn't always work.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would suggest getting another cordless phone besides this one because the volume problems with the handset","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have been using this telephone for 4 months in a home office and the quality is unacceptable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First, battery life has become increasingly short, despite the fact that I have always followed the instructions to let the phone discharge entirely before putting it back in the recharging cradle.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I first got the phone, I had to recharge it about every 5-7 days.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While not great, this is in keeping with the table in the manual which says that battery life in use ( talking ) should be 4.5 hours and in standby should be 11 days.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now, I find that I must recharge the phone every 36-48 hours and it goes from fully charged ( by the battery indicator on the phone ) to unusable very quickly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Twice in recent days I have lost connection during a call because the phone died.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It used to be that I would have several minutes when it began a warning beep to finish the call or change phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Today, I had seconds.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am also unhappy with how the three mailboxes work.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Messages are put in box 1 by default, and you can set a code for boxes 2 and

last week.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since purchasing the new one, I'm starting to notice the same problems.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It goes back to the store for a refund tomorrow and I'll try my luck with another brand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Great features and low cost is attractive, but it's not worth me having to wonder if Panasonic just isn't up to par when it comes to cordless phone technology.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"My goal was to replace a 900Mhz Vtech cordless phone that we've had for several years and an old tape-based answering machine with a single device.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My old cordless still works, but won't hold a charge well, so I was able to use it for sound quality comparisons.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I saw this phone with the two handsets for a good price and gave it a try.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My findings seem to indicate that you simply cannot get the voice clarity and sound quality from ANY digital cordless that you can from an analog phone, period.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I came to this conclusion after trying three other 2.4Ghz digital phones ( including this phone, another Panasonic, and a Motorola ) and comparing to my still-working old 900 Mhz cordless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I finally found a 900 Mhz cordless with an answering system and finally foud one that sounded as good as my old phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"By the way, you can still find both 900Mhz Analog cordless phones and some 2.4 GHz ones as well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Vtech has quite a few ( check www.vtechphones.com ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"None of them have as many features as the digital phones though, which must by why they are now far more popular, despite the sound problems associated with digital.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'll admit, I didn't try any of the newer 5.8 GHz phones.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Maybe they do a better job with digital and can match the clarity of an analog phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now, that said, if you're willing to let sound quality suffer ( hey, it's a PHONE for goodness sake, why let SOUND suffer? ) and are set on a 2.4Ghz Digital cordless, Panasonic has a pretty good offering.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here's what I liked about this one:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Speakerphone on each handset - cool!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM The size and weight of the handset feel pretty good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's thinner and ligher that other phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My wife noticed that immediately and liked it","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM directional selector button for navigating menus - very easy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Although the menu system on this model is not as intuitive as the Panasonic KX-TG2248S.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I seem to remember having to go to an odd place to add an entry to the phone book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM 2 handsets are included and you can buy a third","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM there's a built-in answering system on the base","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"What I didn't like about this phone:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM It sounds bad at BOTH ends of the conversation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At times it almost sounds like a 1/2 duplex speaker phone does.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When you first go off-hook, you hear a solid hiss.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hiss goes down, although it does not disapper once you start dialing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The person we were calling to test it said that this phone gave a\"tinny\" sound to the voice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Switching to our old 900Mhz cordless mid-call resolved it, ans switching back would bring it back.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So we know it's the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM The antenna is too long.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is true of all Panasonic phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you like to sit back in the recliner or easy chair, you have to keep your head turned so the antenna doesn't poke the back of the chair.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't know why Panasonic went with that design.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I think it makes the phones look less modern too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM There's no MEMO button on the answering machine!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We use that all the time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I didn't think anyone even made an answering machine without one, so I never thought to look.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fact, it's the lack of this feature that made me set this phone aside to try the KX-TG2248S even though it only has one handset included.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM There's no phone/speakerphone on the base","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Go back to analog if you're actually concerned with how your phone sounds!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I finally ended up with a Radio Shack 900 MHz cordless that came with 2 handsets and an answering system in the base -- on sale for $ 45! There's no speakerphone on the handset or fancy features, and only one can be used at once, but at least it sounds as good as the phone I'm replacing and gets rid of my old nasty sounding tape-based answering machine","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Well, I went for the panasonic name coz I understand they make ( or was it made? )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"good phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After i returned my KXTG1871 since it started acting funny, i bought this one.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, went on fine for a few months.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now it has started acting funny.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"From the beginning, there is no low battery indicator when you talk. the phone just disconnects!! hey, even a 10 buck phone has the decency to beep before cutting your conversation!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The advantages were the NiMH battery since NiCd is a pain after it dies out pretty soon.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bought this coz it had two handsets, a speaker phone, caller id, a phone book in each handset, an answering machine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That reminds me, the answering machine can be accessed remotely but you cannot delete the messages unless you are at the machine!! hey, if i go on vacation, my voice box is full and even if i check messages, most of them were from crappy sales people selling timeshares, i cannot delete them missing out on any important messages that someone may want to leave!","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"For that matter, you cannot delete messages after checking them from the handset.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"yeah, come back to the damn base unit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Recently i've noticed that the sound is very choppy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"this is a sure let down coz i paid 170 for the thing and its now 50 bucks cheaper but still not worth it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I had a SONY some years back that was the basic cordless phone/answering machine unit you get. it had such good features that except for the caller id, it had many things that this\"advanced\" device doesn't have.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am seriously thinking whether Panasonic are serious about their phones any longer since this was my third Panasonic in two years.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"UPDATE:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Since you are reading this review, I figure you want all the goodies that this phone suggest.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"May I suggest look for these too in addition?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"1. Ringer delay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This one shows the CID after 2-3 rings","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2. Talk time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This one is unpredictable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I charged it over night yesterday and in the morning it went **** though the battery indicator shows full.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"3. 3-way calling using the Phone book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is tricky, coz after you place one call, you want to use the phone book in the same handset to dial another number for a conference call.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"well, you are out of luck with this one coz the phone book is not accessible.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"even my junk nokia cellphone is good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"4. If you move from one area code to another, do you have to edit all phone entries that were local in the former area code or does it automatically add the area code to those numbers?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My $ 7 Bell equipment caller id i bought 5 years ago does that!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Smart, eh?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"5. I'd love to have a phone that uses the AA size NiMH since you can charge them separately and if the battery is to die out, put the call on hold at the base probably and change the batteries not missing your conversation.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"6. Would love to have a base battery backup instead of hooking my phone to my pc's UPS in case we have power blackouts like the last one ( god forbid!! )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"7. the ringer volume setting is cool though i'd prefer a switch instead of menu driven.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"8. I'd prefer if i program my base unit to forward calls when i want it to, to some number i specify (either in person or from remote location.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I could do that in my SONY ) instead of paying the phone company every month for a feature i use once or twice a year.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"9. I'd like a\"backlight\" button instead of having to press any button to see how long i am talking or walk upto some light source if i am outside under the nice starry sky talking either to someone interesting or pretty boring.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Some phones say they are 2.4GHz but require you to switch frequencies.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Atleast this one doesn't require you to do so.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The fidelity is very good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This was a concern (kinda picky ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The expansion capacity is also a plus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Range ( roughly 100 yards + ) is what I would expect, with very little static.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Attractive base unit with large display, easy to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Intuitive..., well made.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sorry if the above review sounds a little... guarded.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've purchased several of these devices with a lot of disappointment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But this one is really great!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base unit is corded and the handset sounds like a corded phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are mailboxes ( 3 ) and a lots of utility regarding privacy, conference, transferring, caller id, call waiting, paging, and even radio contact between several handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For those with really young kids, there is a\"baby monitor\" mode!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In short, this is a nicely designed phone system with a lot of expansion, sounds great and is priced well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Panasonic TGA230B is not only a great phone as a single unit, but when purchased in a set as can be done at Sam's Club, the phone is perfect for the home.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"With the 230, you get a built in, easy to use, and VERY CLEAR speakerphone, all part of the light weight handset that has an add-on belt attachment for easily keeping your phone with you.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A simple push of a button returns you to handset use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All controls, from the four way rocker switch conveniently placed under the viewscreen, to all of the feature buttons, are intelligently placed with functions identified on the button or adjacent to it on the faceplate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The included product documentation is excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The built in display is clear and easy to read.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's a contrast adjustment to allow for lighter or darker letters and digits.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Among the features are multiple ring tones, again very handy if you have multiple units and want to identify one of them for the kids.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The ringer loudness control permits turning the ringer off.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When purchased as part of a system, you've got a home intercom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Any unit can page any other, and there are kits that include a console unit that contains a charger and a multifaceted digital answering machine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Up to three phones and the console can be part of the intercom system, thereby giving you four units.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The digital answerer has built in answer greetings or you can record your own, and it it's necessary to dissuade solicitors at mealtimes, the recorder can deliver its greeting and hang up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Caller-id and call waiting caller-id work with all phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The answer machine console lets you monitor the incoming message before choosing to take the call.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Durable?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I accidentally dropped a phone about three feet to a concrete floor; no damage, the battery door opened and the battery fell out, no damage to the case whatever.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Additional features include battery life indicator and a charging system that will not allow overcharging the battery.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are many good 2.4 Ghz phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our family has always been happy with Panasonic products, looks like our new phones are no exception...","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was looking for a full-featured, multi-handset phone system for my house.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I tried the 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz Vtecs, and while they had the best features, looks, and form factor, they had poor quality sound.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I buy a phone, I don't want hiss.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Panasonics are as clean as a wire-connected phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The range is excellent.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've heard other people complain about the battery life, but I've not found this to be a problem.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can have up to 8 handsets with this unit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The answering machine can be controlled from the handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wish the base unit had more buttons for controlling the answering machine, but since I mostly check from the handsets, this is not much of an issue.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I do wish the answering machine had more memory - it fills up a lot faster than my old answering machine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, it warns you far in advance when it is getting low.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base unit does lack an audio indicator when you have new messages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My old panasonic answering machine had this, and I miss it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As far as looks and form-factor: It's a silver/blue space age look, which is a little over-the-top for my tastes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wish they had a basic black or white.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also wish the size of the phone were more along the lines of a cell phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, my wife disagrees with me on this, and likes a'full size' phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The hands-free speakerphone for the handsets is great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I use it a lot more than I expected.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This phone has a lot of features, which you can look up at the panasonic web site.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I highly recommend this phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have had this phone for about a month now.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So far it has been a great quality piece of equipment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It sounds good, has long range, includes tons of features and is Wi-Fi friendly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"First the phone sounds great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is crisp and clear, even at long distances.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has speakerphone both on the handset and the base station which is clear for both myself and the people I talk to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handset has a'booster' feature that you can flip on when you start going out of range.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It uses more battery power, but helps to keep your signal strong when far away.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The main reason I avoided 2.4 GHZ phones for so long was the interference with my Wi-Fi network.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There have been numerous stories where people have invested a couple hundred in a nice phone and then have to return it or throw it away because it shuts down their Wi-Fi.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I got this phone from my parents as a gift and tried it out right next to my wireless Powerbook.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was able to talk on the phone and surf the net with no problems.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The powerbook still maintained full signal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This phone also sports a lot of features, maybe too many for some.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am a gadget geek so I am enjoying it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My favorite feature is the 3 mailboxes ( so my roommate and I can have separate boxes ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can also transfer a caller to voicemail instead of taking a message for the other person!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No more pads of paper next to the phone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The major con to this phone is the total dependency on the handset.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is no intuitive LCD on the base station, just a number readout for the messages received.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You have to have the handset to do all programming and adjustments to the phones features.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If it isnt charged, your out of luck.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The address book is also hard to get to, you have to click the down arrow, then side arrow, and then scroll through the names.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It should be a single button click to get to the address book.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Intro- If you're a regular reader of my reviews, you might recall that I reviewed another Panasonic cordless not long ago.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"That unit was the KX-TG2215B.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I initially liked that particular phone ( Which I selected based upon my very limited needs in a cordless unit ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, Within a month or so, I began to notice that the battery seemed to be dying much faster than it should have.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Before long, I'd have to charge it 12 hours just to get a few minutes worth of talk time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In spite of the fact that the phone was fine for my need otherwise, it ended up getting only a two star rating from me in the end.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A phone with a dead battery is utterly useless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I eventually got rid of that one and just went back to using my old corded phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Being someone who really hates a lot of wires, I tired of the old corded phone rather quickly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I knew it wasn't going to be long before I purchased another cordless but I decided that I wasn't going to get burned twice in less than a year so I just kept my eyes open for good deals.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I really very rarely ever talk to anyone over the phone so I can't justify spending any more than I have to in order to get a good, reliable cordless with the features I need.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My goal was to find a unit for less than $ 50.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My criteria - For a cordless phone to be useful to me, I had a pretty good idea of the features I wanted.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other than the battery issue, I was very happy with the features and performance of the other Panasonic.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My must-have features were as follows:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Powered by a high capacity Ni-MH battery pack","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM 2.4GHz","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Backlit Caller ID","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Digital security ( I'm not really sure how\" secure\" the digital security touted on some of today's cordless units is, but it's comforting to at least feel like you're protected from eavesdropping and other people placing calls through your line )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM Decent sound quality","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*/SYM I used to have a phone with a backlit keypad and found it to be a very handy feature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I always keep my phone by my bed and I like to know that I don't have to turn on the lights to place a call.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Battery concerns - Once I noticed the battery problem in the old phone, I did some checking around on Epinions and elsewhere and found that most Panasonic cordless units that used the old Ni-cad battery packs had the same problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Therefore, I decided that if I was going to go with another Panasonic, I was going to make sure the unit was powered by a NI-MH ( Nickel Metal Hydride ) battery pack.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ni-cad batteries were always plagued by what is known as the\"memory\" effect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Basically, what this boils down to is the batteries needed to be almost fully drained before recharging.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Continuously topping off Ni-cad batteries can sometimes cause their capacity to gradually decrease more and more until they're totally useless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At any rate, this problem has been discussed enough on the Internet and in complaints to Panasonic that I figured any new Panasonic with a Ni-MH pack would probably be free of this particular problem.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As you'll see, it seems I guessed correctly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The newer Ni-MH batteries also aren't totally immune to this issue but they are much less likely to suffer from this memory effect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At any rate, I'm still amazed that with so many more advanced battery technologies around, cordless phone manufacturers continue to use Ni-cads.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The newer batteries are starting to appear in more and more phones recently though.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Shopping- When it comes to me and wires, there's only so much I can take before I finally get tired of fighting with them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Going back to a corded phone wasn't as easy a transition as I thought it'd be.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Finally, about a week ago, I set out to buy a new cordless.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I looked at a lot of models in almost every store I could think of that sells them.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I couldn't seem to find all of the features I wanted for the price I was willing to pay.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seemed if the phone had a decent battery pack and caller ID, it was either not a 2.4 GHz phone or it was well overy the $ 50 mark.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Yes, I saw plenty of cheap cordless units without caller ID.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"However, I've gotten so used to it that I don't know how I ever lived without it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I finally ( somehow ) ended up at Wal-Mart.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I really very rarely shop there but it was a last ditch effort before giving up and going home.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It was there that I finally selected my new phone - The Panasonic KX-TG2214W.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes, the\" W\" in the model number stands for white.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In general, I like all of my electronics to be black.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It never seems to go out of fashion and it always blends in nicely with all of my other black gadgets.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I was a little disheartened to find that this model was only being sold in white but this particular model has a couple of features that really set it apart from the rest of the sub $ 50 phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For starters, it has a high capacity ( 1500 mAh)Ni-MH battery pack.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The feature that sent it over the top was the lighted keypad.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's almost unheard of for a phone with these features to be less than $ 50!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Initial impressions - Ok, I've been through this before.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This phone looks and feels a lot like the older Panasonic that I bought just a few short months ago.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was surprised to find that the white doesn't bother me as much as I thought it might.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You'd probably expect any product made by such a reputable manufacturer as Panasonic would have a nice, solid look and feel and this unit is no exception.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It has absolutely no sloppy gaps anywhere that I can find.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The layout of the keypad and caller ID is pretty nicely done, although I miss the old navigator key.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's still a navigator key but it's not a four-way key like the one on the older units.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Still, navigating through the menus and doing everything you need to do to set up the phone is all easy enough to learn once you read the manual ( And maybe even if you don't ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As it was with the older Panasonic, the Backlit caller ID has excellent contrast and is large enough to be read at a comfortable distance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The keypad lights up whenever you hit buttons and when the phone rings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oddly, there's no way to turn this feature off in the menu if you want to conserve power.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I guess it's not a huge deal anyway, since the battery pack is listed a being good for over five hours of talk time and 14 days in standby.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Some of the features that are touted on this phone are:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"*Voice Enhancer Technology- I haven't got a clue how this works but it does.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As long as you don't turn the handset volume up to max, it has an overall pleasing effect.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Voices do sound more natural than on Panasonic's older 2.4 GHz units without this technology.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Still, it's kind of gimmicky and you have to wonder why a company like Panasonic would need to\"enhance\" the clarity of the call when last year's models were supposed to be so great ( According to their own packaging last year ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Backlit 3-line LCD - Frankly, I liked the display on the old phone slightly better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When this phone rings, if you have name and number caller ID service, it displays only the name first.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This might seem a convenience but it doesn't help much when your caller ID service lists all cellular calls as\" Cellular call\".","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Of course, it eventually alternates and shows you the actual number but it takes a few seconds, valuable time when you're trying to decide whether or not to answer a call.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The old phone, if I remember correctly, displayed both the name and the number in the same frame.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's about the only gripe I have with the LCD.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Otherwise, the text is clear and legible and as I mentioned, contrast is excellent ( and also adjustable if you don't like the default setting ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This phone also has a 30 number memory for the caller ID and the ability to store 50 names and numbers ( Far more than I'll ever need ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ultra charge - It's nice to see that cordless manufacturers are finally taking notice of people's desperate pleas to shorten the length of time it takes to recharge the battery packs in their phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On top of the incredible 14 day standby time for this battery pack, it will take a full charge in six hours.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a vast improvement but I guess these manufacturers expect us to forget that we're living in a world where you can charge your cell battery pack in three hours and keep a spare charged up and ready to go.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's also the same world in which I can fully charge two AA Ni-MH cells for my digital camera in about an hour.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I guess it all boils down to cost.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cordless phones already cost more than they should and I guess these companies are just happy that people buy them at all.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"How does this phone sound?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Well, I don't require audiophile sound from my telephones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If I can hear and understand what the person on the other end is saying and they can hear and understand me, I'm satisfied.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Naturally, I'm not a big fan of static.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So far all of the calls I've made on this phone have been clear and relatively static free.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It makes me wonder when I hear persistent complaints about static and\"horrible audio quality\" with very similar phones in Panasonic's lineup.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Maybe I'm just not as picky as some folks, who knows? ( Update: 12/04/03 ) As I've used the phone more in recent days, I have indeed noticed a slight\"echo\" in the sound.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Basically, you can kind of hear your own voice in a delayed sort of way after you speak.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's not really bad though and doesn't really affect my overall impression or rating of the phone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The only time when I noticed a really procounced form of this echo was when someone else in my house was on the other line at the same time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Speakerphone - Panasonic seems to be one of the few manufacturers that builds speakerphones into their handsets and sells them for a reasonable price.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The speakerphone on this one does what it's supposed to.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't used it much but when I have, it's given me the ability to talk hands free.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The sound comes out of the speaker on the rear of the handset loud and clear.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Is the battery issue resolved?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes, I believe so.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't encountered any of the problems that I had with the old phone in this unit.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So far, both talk and standby times have been great!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Do I recommend this phone?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes, with a slight reservation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you demand absolute perfection in a cordless unit, you're almost certainly going to be spending far more than the $ 49.95 that I paid for this.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This unit isn't perfect and has some limitations.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't tested the range but it works great in my apartment.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That's all the range I need.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you need more range, judging from some of the other reviews I've read about Panasonic's Gigarange line, you might want to look elsewhere.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My needs are very basic and this unit has features that I may not ever use.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I haven't listed them all, as this review is already running long.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We used to own a Siemens 2415, a predecessor to the 4215.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The 2415 phone was great, but failed the drop and bounce test, we needed a new phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We actually bought an ATandT 2.4Ghz phone first, assuming that the clarity of the calls we got with the 2415 was to do with the digital transmission on that frequency rather than something specific about the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That was a mistake, the ATandT calls were simply not that clear and the range of the phone was not as good as the 2415.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We returned the ATandT phone and bought a 4215 ( and another 4215 handset ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a great phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For us the major issue with a phone more than features is the clarity of the calls and with the 4215 ( even in speakerphone mode ) it is exceptional.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We did find you need to read the manual to learn how to use all of the features correctly, but the on-screen LCD prompts you for most things.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Range is great.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"With the base station at the rear of our house, we can use the phone with no loss of clarity outside at the front of our house, over 60 feet away.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I am sure it would go father but we do not have that need.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In case anyway reading this is not aware, getting a 2.4Ghz or 5.8Ghz digital cordless is very different to getting an analog cordless phone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Analog phone call quality is typically poorer and will degrade the further away from the base station you get.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You may also notice they have more visible antenna on both the base and the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other often missed difference is the security of your calls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Its just too easy to receive analog telephone calls using something as cheap as a baby monitor!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You would not be able to listen into a digital cordless transmission as easily.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The phone is packed with all the features you would expect, directory, caller id display and so on.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The answer machine does everything you could want including remote access.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A small gripe would be that it comes with Ni-Cd rechargeable batteries and I would have preferred Ni-MH as these do not have the memory effect of Ni-Cd, however as the batteries are standard size AA rechargables you can replace them very easily with Ni-MH when the Ni-Cds give up.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"One final cool feature is the voice activated dialing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Available on some cellular wireless phone for sometime now, the 4215 allows you to pick directory entries simply by speaking the persons name.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As you can guess, I love this phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Pros: Easy set up/great features / understandable instructions / user friendly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Cons: Could have made the handset with a more comfortable, less irritating design for ear area.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instructions are clear and the phone is easy to set up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The features are incredible.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The fact that you can have extension phones all over the house is amazing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phone book, once set up in any unit can be copied to all other phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can use the phone to page another phone, transfer a call, conference, or use like an intercom.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It has a room monitoring feature, like for a baby's room, or if you were caring for someone who was really sick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The distance from home with good reception is about 1000 feet.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a booster feature available but I have not tried it all the way to the hunting shack ( reason I chose 5.8 gh ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You don't have to use the\"answering machine\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you don't press the\" Answer On\" button, which is indicated by a red light, you will have a plain old regular phone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I am a little dismayed that the answering machine will only hold 15 minutes of calls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'll have to remember to clear it more often.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phone works great once you make adjustments in the setting up of the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's fun to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We needed more cordless handsets, and add caller ID to our phone functionality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We are extremely happy with the sound clarity, reception, functionality, expandability, and value of this system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We already own another 2.4GHz Panasonic cordless phone and we love it so we decided to stick with Panasonic and the 2.4GHz line:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"http://www.epinions.com/elec-review-7DE9-27970EB-394FC57C-prod2","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"While at Fry's ( to my surprise ), a sales associate actually helped us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I told her what I was looking at ( I was already holding a single Panasonic 2.4GHz unit ) when she ( to her credit ) showed us this model; which is the same technology, but has 2 handsets with one single basestation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"That means that there is only one unit to plug to the phone jack, which both the handsets utilize.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The other minibase is just a charging station.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This allows you to put the other unit's minibase anywhere in the house near a power outlet ( much more common than a phone jack ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Plus, in the future we can add a 3rd handset and all 3 would still utilize the single main basestation.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each unit can intercom to each other, and all have caller ID using the crystal clear clarity of Panasonic's 2.4GHz.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All of this for under $ 100.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"PHYSICAL FEATURES","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base station is reasonably small and has a telephone jack and wall-wort AC adaptor for power.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is approximately 2 handsets in size and it allows you to place one handset (either one ) either face down or face up ( latter allows you to see caller ID without picking it up first ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"There are 3 intercom buttons which allow you to locate and intercom to any of the handset units.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A single antenna is used to transmit/receive with the handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's all enclosed in a clean white plastic casing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handsets are like long bars of soap and are easy to hold.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A rigid 3 inch antenna sticks out at the top and for the most part doesn't manage to get in the way.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"An optional belt clip can be attached the the back of the phone and there is an mic/earphone jack for hands-free headsets ( which works well ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The buttons are reasonably laid out, but they are a little small for aging eyes ( over 60 ) to see.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The OFF and CALL buttons, the most commonly pressed buttons ( think END and SEND on your cell phone ) are curiously smaller than the number pad, which makes it a short hunt for people unfamiliar with the unit to find... ie guests.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The screen is green back lit LCD display which is easy to read.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"RECEPTION","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was a little concerned that the basestation only has 1 antenna, compared to our older Panasonic 2.4GHz unit which has 2 antenna for diversity ( more immune to\"pockets\" of bad reception ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, in practice I have found that these units have extremely good reception and have yet to experience the pockets of bad reception anywhere in the house or garage.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The range easily covers our entire home property.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I should also mention that in addition to our other 2.4GHz phone, we also have a 802.11b wireless network in our house ( which also uses the 2.4GHz spectrum ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We have never experienced any interference on the phone by the other devices, and we haven't noticed interference with our network.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"CALLER ID AND OPERATION","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phones are easy to use and bring a more\"cell phone like\" functionality to the home phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As calls come in, the phone performs caller ID.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It takes till the 2nd ring to figure out the number, but I think this is typical.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you have previously saved the number and labelled it, then that text label will also show up with the number.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Because the display has 2 lines, it's really nice to see both the number and the label at the same time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can either push the CALL button for a dial tone and dial the desired number as a regular phone, or you can predial the number ( which means you can also backspace if you err ) and then press CALL ( like a cell phone ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the standard functions like redial, flash, and constant button tones are all there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As mentioned above, there is a phone number directory which allows you to enter or save caller ID numbers with labels ( ie\" Grandma\" ) to a phone directory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Manipulating the menu can be a little confusing and counter intuitive; this part could stand for improvement.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"However, the most annoying thing is that each hand set maintains it's own directory, which means you have to enter each entry twice; once for each phone, for both phones to have it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is no directory synchronization feature.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Panasonic should really consider adding this functionality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It's not convenient to spontaneously add the caller ID received phone call to both directories.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Not a show stopper, but it's something to be improved in future models.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Each handset also has speaker phone capability, a wonderful feature for a handset.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"An extra speaker on the back of the phone serves as the loud speaker.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Battery is a rechargeable NiCd which easily last several days.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"SUMMARY","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Combine the clarity of 2.4GHz, the ease of a single basestation and remote charging station, caller ID, speaker phone, good battery life, and quality construction; these phones are easily the most used phones in our home.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Set at a very reasonable price point ( for quality ), I can recommend this set to any body without hesitation.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Our Sony phones died after 7 years...which I don't think is too bad for a cordless phone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We wanted something less bulky, clear sound and easy to operate.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My husband hates talking on the phone, so I had to find something light-weight and comfortable.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This phone has it all!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"2.4G is great for the country, and no problems near the microwave.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Lighted key pad helps in low light times.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can choose from 6 different ring tones, but it had no\"regular\" phone ring, these are all very electronic sounding.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The intercom comes in handy when I'm upstairs and he is downstairs.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And, having an extra handset with no need for a phone jack saved us some\"renovations\"","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have had the Panasonic 2 line system since last November and I really enjoy its feautres.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even some companies fail to offer the features of this phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Here is my own review from personal everyday use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I won't explain the answering machine in detail as it is a straight forward easy to use machine with 5 greetings and ring selections (2-7 ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Answering Machine secret: There is a secret that I found out when I was playing around with the system seeing which settings I like.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the answering system you can set up the main message and direct callers to different voicemail extensions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It works like the automated attendant system so I don't see why Panasonic added this feature to the system.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Any idea?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Automated Attendant System:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This system has 5 greetings on two lines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can program the same greeting on both lines.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the pre-recorded greeting it is a bland lady saying\" Automated Attendent System please enter the extension you wish to reach\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Change this before you play around with the settings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I love being able to call my house and press the extension number followed by the pound sign and it says\" Please wait a moment\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It can also say\" Sorry this line is busy\" when someone is on their extension and it lets you leave a message following the incomplete call handilng menu which is simple to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It can even say\" Sorry there is no space for recording\" when your mailbox is full.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It will let you loop-back to the main greeting by pressing 2. No more hang-ups.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now let me tell you you can not program the greetings for the time of day.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So lets say you are working at a company the receptionist will have to manually change the greetings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also has no dial-by-name directory found on PBX only systems.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Voicemail:If you want your phone to go into voicemail after 2 rings it can.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This feature is called forward no answer like on company phones if you don't pick up after 2 rings it will go right into your voicemail and your personal greeting will play.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"If you have this feature turned off in the menu on your handset then it will ring 5 times and play the generic greeting which is ok but don't you want your own greeting?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You have the option of 50 minutes or 100 minutes of recording time including the Automated Attendant greetings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have never used up all the time even with all the messsages our household gets.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You can easily access your messages while you are away from your desk by calling in the main number and pressing */SYM then your 4 digit passcode.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another Voicemail secret:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you need to check the receptionist mailbox( Reffered to as The General Delivery Mailbox ) you can press 4 then after the messages are heard then press 4 again and it will get you back to your mailbox.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Everything is a single call operation on this system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Voicemail/system cons: I don't like that the General Delivery Mailbox only has the generic greeting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I like to be able to say ( Were sorry there is no receptionist available please leave a message.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Also there is no quick messaging by pressing ** twice and having it say enter the destination for your message.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This can only be done if you are logged into your mailbox.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also having to press # /# to get an extension is a minor con.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is no automatic transfer to the receptionist if no action is taken.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"At some companies it will say\" Invalid entry transferring to an attendant one moment please\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Operator Counsle: The main unit with the operator rings 5 times you got that right then it plays a generic greeting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also if you are on a rotary dial phone you have to wait for the main greeting to play 3 times it is good for tone users and bad for other rotary users.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No Dial By Name Directory:","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This needs to be added because it is easier for people to get into extensions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For instance it could say to dial by name press 411 then the caller would be insturcted from there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handset Registration:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh my!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You have to buy a handset for each extension.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is no way of saving money by just having a\"guest mailbox\" where it goes right to voicemail wihtout rining the extension.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Oh well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Name Directory:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can store a lot of your friends names and numbers in the phonebook directory.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A good feature for all of us.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Caller ID:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't use this feature but the manual says that it will tell how many times a caller called.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can go on and on on this phone system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you want to discuss this system please email me at vipclub@msn.com.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If there is any professionals out there I would like to discuss voicemail systems( Nortel, Toshiba Panasonic etc ) as this is my hobby and a possible career.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our 15 year old cassette-tape answering machine died.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our upstairs cordless phone was near death.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Time to go phone shopping.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I was attracted to idea of the new expandable cordless phone systems... the kind with a single base station and the ability to add several handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The many benefits of such systems include the ability to use the handset and base stations as intercoms and the ability to transfer calls from one handset to another.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Those items are just the beginning of the long list of cool features of the Panasonic KX-TG5110M.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There are two ways you can buy this phone system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The first is as a package with the base station and one handset ( Model KX-TG5100M).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This sells for around $ 200.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can also buy a package that contains the base station and TWO handsets ( Model KX-TG5110M), which you can usually find for around $ 265.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a good deal, because the individual handsets sell for $ 79-89 each.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you know you need more than one handset, definitely try to find the two-handset package, and save yourself a few bucks.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When I was buying, neither Circuit City nor Best Buy carried the two-handset package.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Sears and Amazon.com","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"did.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I bought mine from Amazon.com.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"THE TECHNICAL STUFF","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This phone system works in the new 5.8 GHz frequency range.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The advantage of this over the more common 2.4 GHz phones is that the latter is more prone to interference from microwave ovens.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also, if you have an 802.11b wireless computer network in your house or building, that works on the 2.4 GHz frequency range, it could cause interference with that kind of phone system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This Panasonic system uses digital spread-spectrum technology, which constantly and automatically searches for the clearest channels in the band to give interference-free performance.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In my experience, it works flawlessly...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This phone really sounds exactly like a good corded phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"At my house, the range is about the same as what I got with my previous 900 MHz phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I can go outside on the front porch, but if I venture about 30 feet down the driveway, the reception goes away quickly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Inside the house, there are no dead spots, and reception is flawless, both upstairs and downstairs.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"THE BASE STATION","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base station is a sleek, attractive compact unit with a large LCD screen that displays its many functions.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Unlike Panasonic's 2.4 GHz models, which come in gaudy shades of purple and silver, these phones have an attractive, businesslike platinum color.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The LCD screen displays caller ID info, your phone book, which can store up to 50 numbers, the interface for the digital answering system, and the menus that you use to set up the phone's features.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The display is backlit, large, with nice big readable text.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a large circular, 4-way rocking navigation control which allows you to scroll through your phone book, caller ID list, as well as menus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also acts as the base station's volume control.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base station can be used stand-alone as a speakerphone if there is no handset handy.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"HANDSETS","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The KX-TG5110M system can handle up to eight handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each handset has a small LCD screen, with 3 soft key buttons that perform various functions, labeled on the screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even though the screen is smaller, and the handset contains fewer buttons, you can perform nearly all of the functions on the handset that you can on the base station.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most of the buttons on the handset are backlit, and light up when you touch any button.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"MINOR GRIPE # 1: For some reason, Panasonic did not backlight the four most important buttons ( Talk, Speakerphone, Off, and Hold ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The handsets are solidly built, and feel good in your hand.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They are a little larger than those on some of the competing phones, but I'm not bothered by that.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The buttons have good feel, and a quiet beep gives you good feedback with each press.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The center of the handset has a rocking joystick-like navigation control, which performs the same functions as the big one on the base station.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"In fact, the really nice thing about this system is that the handsets operate like minature versions of the base station.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"MINOR GRIPE # 2: For some reason Panasonic labeled some of the buttons with slightly different names... for example on the base station there is a button labeled\" Hold/Clear\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is an equivalent button on the handset, but it's called\" Erase\".","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"They both do the same thing, but they have different names.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Needless confusion.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Handsets come with their own speakerphones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The speaker is in the back of the handset.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is not really loud, but it does work, and it beats holding the phone to your ear while you're on hold for 45 minutes.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Headset fans can plug in to a jack on the side, and use the included belt clip.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Each handset is an intercom that can call any or all of the other handsets or the base station.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you answer an outside call, and you want to transfer the call to another handset, it's really easy to do so.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base station has a handset locator button, so you can find that handset that got buried under the dirty laundry.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is possible to use up to 4 handsets and the base station simultaneously in a conference call.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A handset can also be used as a baby monitor, but I would guess that that would eat up your battery pretty quickly.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One really cool feature is that you can transfer an entire phone book list or an individual phone book entry from any handset or the base station to any other handset.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"MAJOR COMPLAINT # 1: Panasonic decided to use NiCad handset batteries with this phone, instead of the much superior NiMH batteries.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Many reviewers had complaints about poor battery life, and charging memory problems with Panasonic's 2.4GHz line, and this new model was an opportunity for them to fix that by using better batteries.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've seen reviews elsewhere that say that the batteries do work better on these phones, but time will tell.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handset also has a signal booster mode, which you can turn on when reception becomes iffy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It give you a little more range, but it also cuts down on your battery life.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"THE ANSWERING SYSTEM","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base station contains a digital answering system that supports an outgoing message of up to 3 minutes, and 15 minutes of message recording time, all digitally recorded.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The sound quality isn't as good as your CD player, but it's not bad.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The system has three separate voice-mail boxes ( which is perfect at our house, because there are three of us ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can use your outgoing message to instruct callers to hit pound-1 to talk to Dad, pound-2 to talk to Mom, etc..","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you don't need separate voicemail boxes, you are not forced to use them.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Messages for any of the mailboxes can be retrieved at the base station or on any of the handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A flashing indicator on the LCD lets you know which mailboxes contain fresh messages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All messages have a time/date stamp.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is an option for slowing down the playback of messages.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The system uses flash memory, so if the power goes out, you don't lose your messages.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The answering system works just the way you'd expect it to, and it's very intuitive to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"CONCLUSIONS","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I thought long and hard before spending this kind of dough on a phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But when you balance that high price against the long list of great features that you can use every day, along with excellent build quality, great sound, good looks, ease of use, the Panasonic KX-TG5110M becomes a solid choice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I compared it to the even more expensive Siemens systems, and found it to be a better choice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After using it for a few weeks, I don't regret the purchase at all.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Now, I've just got to keep filling the swearing jar, so I can get a few more handsets for around the house.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I recently had to replace my office phone system to eliminate a barely functional Siemens multi-line phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also needed a new answering system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Our office has gone through a number of answering systems over the years.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All have left something to desire.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After reading reviews here at Epinions we decided to change to the Panasonic KX-TG2000B.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base unit is well constructed and has a very large and useful LCD display, which is a nice change of pace from the Lilliputian LC D's found on most phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The base unit has a corded handset and offers a jack for headset use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"A very nice addition is a\" Headset\" button, which is used to answer calls when then headset is in use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Finally a manufacture understands how a headset is actually used.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The headset can be programmed with both speed dial and directory listings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One draw back here is that the handsets do not share the base station directories.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"You must program the handsets individually.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Setup of the base unit is simple and is achieved by a few well marked buttons in conjunction with the LCD display.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The answering system and\" Auto Attendant\" functions are a little confusing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The answering machine function can be turned on to answer calls on either phone line and offers one general voice mail delivery box.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The\" Auto Attendant\" feature however can route calls to individual handsets on answering the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This function offers a separate voice mail box for each handset used.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is a draw back as you can not use multiple mailboxes in the answer mode.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We would have liked to use several mailboxes to announce address and appointment information.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is however not possible.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We do not use the\"auto Attendant\" feature, but it may be useful in a larger office with no receptionist to field calls.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The answering system is efficient and fast.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The electronic voice is a pleasant female voice which announces mailbox activity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"New messages are easily spotted as the voice mail button is a large clear button which flashes a red icon when a new message is taken.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The voice is fast and does not slow down the user.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"A pleasant treat for anyone who has labored to listen to the slow banter of other voice mail systems.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The handsets are well constructed and have a solid heavy feel.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Buttons are well marked and the LCD display and keypad light up on use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sound quality is exceptional with little discernable difference between the handsets and a corded phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Truly first class sound.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Transferring calls from one phone to the next is a bit of a task.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We have placed small notes on the phones with instructions on how to transfer.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"After a few more weeks we will have learned the system and then be able to remove the notes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I feel that the KX-TG2000B has given us a far more reliable phone and answering solution.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There is a serious lack of high quality phones and answering systems on the market.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Panasonic KX-TG2000B is thankfully not one of these poor quality contenders.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It is a first class product with few weaknesses.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the price it is a steal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wish I had bought one long ago!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have been looking for a good business phone that has enough features and with good sound quality.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This model is an excellent home-office tool.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Perhaps I am not using it as most people would use it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have a second line wired to my office only so expanding it elsewhere in the house won't be necessary.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I may add a cordless unit for downstairs in case I'm there or when I have small meetings in my living room.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then I'll treat it as an extension line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But the fact that I have the ability to walk in and around the house with the 2.4GHz phone and never miss a call is great.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Every other phone in the house is a regular 900Mhz or a corded phone, so nobody can mistakenly answer my business line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The unit is rich with features and is easy to setup with the LDC screen.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The voice-mail system is very good too.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The digitized voice is pleasant to hear, an upgrade from Panasonic's previous answering machines with robot-sounding prompts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I don't use the answering system for the business line, however.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I subscribe to PacBell's message center so that in case I am on the phone, the line could still take a message.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Otherwise it would ring and ring with call waiting.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I also like the slanted look of the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"There's the psychological effect of using the base unit with the attached headset- sort of a power trip...","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But Panasonic overlooked a big feature: The Mute Button.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On conference calls I have to remain pretty quiet, or use the conferecing system's own mute feature.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This is one of the biggest flaws I see on the unit.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm going to Radio Shack to see if I could find some kind of\"muteable\" headset adapter.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If that exists, problem solved.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would highly recommend this phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Panasonic, in my opinion makes the best phones out there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I've virtually owned almost every other cordless unit out there.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This one is a keeper.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It seems that every year I buy 3-4 cordless phones because the last years begin to die.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, this time I decided that I needed to buy better phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I tried the Siemens Gigaset phone, but it wasn't so good ( see my opinion on that... )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Panasonic is pretty neat - I have 3 cordless handsets in addition to the base station ( base comes with one cordless ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The individual phones were a problem for me because I would regularly put the phone in the wrong base station; some of the cordless phones out there aren't real tolerant of that.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The Panasonic just has chargers, which is great!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I now have phones on every floor of the house, all tied together.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It also has an auto-attendant and up to 8 voicemail boxes, which is really nice for small businesses.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I would recommend getting the second line if you don't have one yet.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I'm still using it with a single line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The voice quality is wonderful, even at a good distance ( 100 ft or more ), through walls, etc.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Even the speakerphone ( in the base station ) works well.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"My one complaint ( which I think applies to all 2.4Ghz phones ) is that when I use my microwave, it garbles the reception on the phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mostly, it sounds like you're under water.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Oh - one last thing - once a call is answered by a handset, you can't just turn on another handset and join in.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It works like a PBX system, where the handsets have their own extension number ( they can all answer incoming calls, though ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So, to have more than one handset on the same line at the same time, you have to\"intercom\" to the other handset, and\" conference\" the call.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Again, good for businesses, not so great for my home use.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"It's liveable, though.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have a home office and three kids ( 11, 13 and 15 years old ) and this phone system is awesome!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"We've been using it for about 9 months now.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The kids phones are set to not ring when the business line rings so they don't answer my business calls.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I also have my business line set for a different sound when it rings.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The kids cannot pick up my business line while I am on it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"I have programmed all of my handsets to NOT answer when the phone is lifted out of the charger, I can pick up the phone to see who is calling and decide whether or not to answer the call.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"We can all communicate with eachother throughout the house with the phones, which is great when the kids are sick.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It only took a couple of days to get used to which phone is in which room ( ie phone # 1 is in the office, phone # 2 is in the family room etc. )","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It is so easy to transfer calls to eachother, we do it all the time.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"It doesn't have a mute button but it does have a hold button, which is even better.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"When a call comes in you can save the caller ID info directly into your phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can edit your Directory List info if necessary.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The kids had no trouble learning how to use it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"They each have their own friends' numbers saved in their own phones and I have mine.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The caller ID and the Directory List are so easy to use.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The battery lasts for days, for those times when we forget to put them back in the charger at night.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I purchased a headset and we have all used it at different times and are very happy with it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I wasn't sure this phone system would work the way that I had hoped, it was expensive, but I took a chance and it does everything ( and more ) that I had hoped!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I hope they come out with a 2-line version, but that would be a different review.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had my doubts about getting this phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You'll find several negative reviews from other consumers.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most of them complain about poor range or clarity.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm glad to say that I haven't experienced either of these issues.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"In fact, the phone is so clear that people on the other end of the line don't know I'm using a cordless phone.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"As far as range goes, I live in a decent size house on a 1/4 acre lot.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"So long as I can make it to the mailbox or yard while on the phone, I'm happy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Yes, I've gone further.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No, I haven't test the limits.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Anyway, this phone's base and handset transmit on the 5.8 ghz band, unlike other 5.8 phones with handsets that return a 2.4 ghz signal.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I'm on a wireless network and use VPN secured access when working.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I had to get this phone, because my older 2.4 ghz phone kept causing my secure link to hiccup ( which it doesn't like ), forcing me to continually log on with my secureid pin.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Damn telemarketers!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This phone has all of the features you'd expect from a high end phone.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The cake topper is the speakerphone built into each handset.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Then there's the ability to transfer calls.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Let's say your in the garage and you answer the phone, but it's actually for your wife.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"No problem.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Just hit the transfer button and the 2nd unit rings until she picks it up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"As far as simplicity goes, the menu/button structure isn't terribly difficult to figure out.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you can store a number on your cell phone, this will be a breeze.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Final note: These are expensive phones.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"If you have a wireless network and don't want t flip the bill for 5.8, there's always good ole 900 mhz.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Wanted a 5.8 ghz phone to replace a 900 mhz model, skipped 2.4 ghz range to avoid interference with in home wi-fi set up.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Also wanted Caller ID but did not need digital answering feature since we have SBC Voice mail.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This was a second choice which I selected after buying and returning Vtech 5831 ( see separate review ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Now that I have this phone I can recommend it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phone has a nice amber backlit LCD.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Not as many pixels as the Vtech model but quite readable.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Large talk button with smaller function buttons arrayed around it requires a little practice but a well written manual comes with the package and we've quickly learned to use it.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sound quality is excellent and it is true 5.8 ghz both ways between base unit and handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The package comes with 2 handsets -- and 2 chargers -- a real plus.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"All the other packages provide one handset and want to sell you additional handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am not sure if you can add more handsets to this setup, but having 2 out of the box is a very good deal.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"C'mon, unless you live in a mansion, how many handsets do you really need?","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The only thing that I don't like about this product is that each handset is an island unto itself; there is no way to synchronize the address books between handsets.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So you have to create each address book separately.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"To be fair, I am not sure that any other cordless phone offers the kind of\"address book synchronization\" I am complaining about, so this may be more of a personal gripe.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Still, my wife and I beam address book data between our PDA's, so this is not exactly a cutting edge technology.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Maybe someday they will include IR beaming between the handsets.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Until that day comes, this is still a very good buy.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The phone works, sounds great, is true 5.8 ghz, is easy to program, and you get 2 handsets in the box.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Highly recommended.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I do not review the answering machine feature because we have voice mail through our Telco and do not need it.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This phone is totally solid on all of the features it touts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Sound Quality- Great!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I haven't had any problems with interference like phizzes or pops.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Most useful features:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Speakerphone in handsets as well as base.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I use it all the time for checking our voicemail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Phone Book sharing: Add all your contacts into one handset, then\" copy\" them to all the other handsets/base.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ability to be using all the handsets at the same time: Do not be fooled by other 5.8 Ghz phones.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Some of them ( Uniden ) do not actually allow both handsets to be used simultaneously.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"This one does.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"But, it also allows you to set a\"privacy\" feature before you place a call so that the other handset cannot be used to hear your call.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Intercom feature: Allows you to talk to the other handset or base while offline ( not on a telephone call ).","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Plus, you can choose to call a specific handset ( like an extension ) or all of them at once.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Key Navigation: I was very pleased with the layout of the keys which allowed for easy navigation and addition of contacts.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Battery Strength indicator: This seems like a no-brainer for all cordless phones, but this is the first one I have seen that actually has it!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Thank you Panasonic!","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Previous phones made me dash to a corded phone when the beeps went off, indicating that it was dying....NOW.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The selectable ring tones are nice.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"You can choose from JARRING to sooothing.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"And in between of course.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Ergonomics: Good.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Nothing gets in the way ( like chin next to the\"off\" button ) Easy to hold.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Belt clips were sort of a struggle to install though.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Other features it has, but I haven't really used:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Room Monitor: we already have a baby monitor and I don't care to snoop on guests so...","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Digital Answering System: I sent an email to Panasonic asking if they were going to make a system without it and the answer was no.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"So, we bit the bullet and found that you can turn it off and it doesn't at all get in the way if you use your Telco company's voice mail system.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Which is the way to go if you can ( but that is another review ).","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"On the other hand, it doesn't have any features which let you know that you have voicemail like other phones, but you still have the stuttered dial tone and we also have external Caller ID boxes which indicate voicemail.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"One minor gripe:","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Caller ID and Multiple Local Area codes: So far the weakest link on this system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Instead of just plugging in say 3 area codes to indicate that they are local calls, you have to click this'edit' button on the handset for calls which have come in to change them from; 1-756-222-2222 to 756-222-2222, then call the number.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Once you have done this, it will remember that any number with that area code is local.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The manual says it will do this for up to 4 area codes.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Another stickler is that this setting is saved individually on each handset.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Bought this phone 2 weeks ago and so far I am very pleased.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am a professional in the business telecommunications field specializing in Key and PBX system design.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I am currently using the KXTG5110 at my home however, I have tested it via analog connection to my office Key system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This makes for a creative solution in that any analog phone may be deployed through an available analog port on a business phones system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"The KXTG5110 becomes an extension in itself but now you get the ability to conference multiple Panasonic handsets behind the key system while on an intercom OR an outside line.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"This can be very cost effective as it economizes on analog ports on the phone system.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"For the rest of us though, it will be a great phone for the household.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"I have found no issues regarding battery life as long as you FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE USER GUIDE.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"Don't recharge the handset until the display message directs you to do so.","target":"Genuine positive"},{"sentence":"The Panasonic headset work seamlessly and provides an inline volume and mute control.","target":"Genuine negative"},{"sentence":"Mailboxes are able to each have their own greeting and you can set the time limit for incoming messages but only on a global
